However, after the victim Oisin Tymon said that he did not want to press charges, officers have now decided to drop the probe without taking action against Clarkson. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: \u2018North Yorkshire Police has now completed its routine enquiries following the incident at Hawes involving Mr Jeremy Clarkson, and we will not be pursuing this matter any further. \u2018North Yorkshire Police takes a thorough and victim-led approach to all investigations. \u2018Last week, the person at the centre of the incident, Mr Tymon, said that he did not wish the police to take action on his behalf. \u2018However, at that point we still needed to speak to some members of the public who were present at the time of the incident, who had been affected by the event, and whose views also needed to be considered. \u2018Now that all the interviews are complete, we have properly established that there is no need for further police action.\u2019 The incident, described as a 'fracas' by BBC officials, occurred when Clarkson discovered that the hotel where he was staying could not serve him a hot meal following a day's filming.

Mr Clarkson was suspended as Top Gear presenter as soon as news of the fight came to light, and after the report was released the BBC announced that it would not renew his contract. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately, and the producer told North Yorkshire Police he did not want to see Mr Clarkson prosecuted.

Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. \"My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,\" Klitschko told CNN. \"I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. \"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. \"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said. \"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy.

Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. \"My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,\" Klitschko told CNN. \"I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. \"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. \"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said. \"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want. \"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and", "filter_p": 1}

Hundreds of British teenagers see ISIS as 'pop idols' like One Direction and Justin Bieber, putting children in danger of being radicalised, the country's most senior Muslim prosecutor has said. Nafir Afzal said teenagers are at risk of 'jihadimania' and warned that 'another 7/7' could happen unless Britain makes sweeping changes to the way it tackles terrorism. Mr Afzal, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the north-west, said children are 'manipulated' by Islamists and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation. He told the Guardian's Nigel Bunyan: 'The boys want to be like them and the girls want to be with them. That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image. 'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers \u2013 they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.' Mr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services. The prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack. He believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures. 'At the moment, even the language is wrong. People talk about Isis as if they have some kind of religious basis or political dimension \u2013 a kind of glossy, glorious campaign,' he said. Mr Afzal said teenagers are 'manipulated' by ISIS (file picture) and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation . The prosecutor said some Muslim teenagers see Islamists as 'pop idols' like Justin Bieber (left) and One Direction (Harry Styles, right) 'The reality is that they're no more than narcissistic, murderous cowboys. We need to stand up and say that very, very clearly, rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols.' Hundreds of young Muslims are thought to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, but Mr Afzal believes there are far more 'ticking time bombs' still in Britain. His comments came as it emerged that the Labour councillor's son caught trying to cross from Turkey to Syria with his family may be part of an extremist group.

The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.

For some women, the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent, which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects \u2013 including complete hair loss, nausea, sickness, weight gain or loss, and extreme fatigue \u2013 can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself. But experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary.

Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify the nature of the threats, but said he was \"very concerned\" for their safety and that of their families. He did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do. Another sheriff's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency's drug unit pending the review of the April 2 shooting of Harris following a weapons sting. Glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions, saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving Bates has been settled. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris' death. Bates, who is free on $25,000 bond pending trial, shot Harris with his handgun after calling out, \"Taser, Taser,\" -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue Harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies.

But he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing, and said Monday that the FBI had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. Bates is white. Harris was black. There have been allegations, first reported by the Tulsa World newspaper, that some of Bates' training records had been forged, or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force. The sheriff denied those allegations, saying he was certain Bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training. He said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records, and said he had not issued any training waivers for Bates, with whom he has been friends for more than two decades. But he said he supported prosecutor's decision to proceed with the case. He also said he had brought in a Dallas police consultant who had previously examined the office's policies and procedures for another look. Harris' family has said the shooting reveals \"a deep-seated problem\" within the department and has demanded justice, and changes in policy."}

Mendes' only two professional losses have come at the hands of the Brazilian king and Lamas also dropped a decision to Aldo when the two met in February last year. But it is Aldo's upcoming opponent, Irishman McGregor, who has dominated conversation in the lead up to this weekend's fight. Opponents Chad Mendes and Ricardo Lamas face off during the UFC weigh-in at the Patriot Center . Lamas holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym on in Fairfax, Virginia . 'I thought Aldo handled it well' said Team Alpha Male's Mendes, when asked about Aldo's reaction to McGregor snatching the championship belt on stage in Dublin.

They say the results show just how modern lifestyles and diets have changed us - and that the bacteria they found could be potentially beneficial to modern society. Researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are an indigenous ethnic group in the Amazonian region of South America. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are hunter-gatherers. They gather wild bananas, seasonal fruits, palm hearts and cassava. They hunt birds, small mammals, crabs, frogs, small fish and the occasional peccary, monkey or tapir. The group doesn't grow food or domesticate livestock. The researchers found that Yanomami people harbor microbiomes with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. 'That tells us that Western diets and lifestyles have a great impact on our microbiomes', experts at University of San Diego said. 'Studying the microbiomes of people in remote areas may hold the key to understanding microbes we have lost through antibiotics, sealed buildings and lack of exposure to the outdoors,' said study co-author Rob Knight. In the new study published April 17 by Science Advances, researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. This information revealed, for the first time, the species of bacteria that co-exist with people who have never been exposed to industrialized society, including Western food and antibiotics. 'Our findings emphasize the need for extensive characterization of the function of the microbiome and resistome in remote nonwesternized populations before globalization of modern practices affects potentially beneficial bacteria harbored in the human body,' the researchers wrote. Many Yanomami now regularly interact with Western civilization through trade, but some villages have never had contact with non-Yanomami people. One such unmapped village was first spotted by an army helicopter passing overhead in 2008. In 2009, a medical mission landed there. As part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered. The samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study. Yanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests . Thousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international. The Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade. The Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a Summarize the article in three sentences.

There has been plenty of speculation about the Belgium international and he even admitted himself in February he fancied a new challenge and had an ambition to play in the Champions League next season. Injuries have prevented the 27-year-old from really finding his best form this campaign with a run of consistent performances but Martinez was delighted to see him score his first Premier League goal since December 28 in last weekend's win over Burnley. Kevin Mirallas has been linked with a move away from Everton following an injury-hit term at the Toffees . Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits to not knowing what the future holds for his Belgian star . There were reports this week Tottenham would try to make the forward part of a swap deal with their winger Aaron Lennon, who is currently on loan at Goodison Park. However, Martinez backed Mirallas to put the continuing debate about his future to one side. 'The total honest truth is we don't know what is going to happen in the future,' he said. 'I heard somewhere that he had one year left and it was a bit of an unsettled situation but that is not the case, he has two years left. 'I don't think it has ever been an issue.

Several people have been arrested and local authorities have spent thousands of dollars cleaning up the statues.", "article": "Excrement thrown at the statue of British colonialist Cecil John Rhodes has triggered a wave of protests across South Africa against 'racist' historical figures. Memorials to South Africa's colonial past were defaced by mainly young black protesters as statues of British monarchs Queen Victoria and King George V were splashed with paint in the cities of Port Elizabeth and Durban respectively. Vandals poured paint over Scottish-South African missionary Andrew Murray's statue in the Western Cape. War memorials were also defaced. A bronze rider marking the Anglo-Boer War from 1899 to 1902, was toppled from his horse. Object of anger: This statue of Queen Victoria outside the Port Elizabeth city library in South Africa is among a number of memorials to British colonials that have been vandalised during protests against 'racist' figures . A statue of a British soldier lays on the ground after being broken off its base in Port Elizabeth, South Africa . The defaced statue of British mining magnate and politician, Cecil John Rhodes, is lifted by a crane, from its position at the University of Cape Town (left), while (right) a chair marks the spot on the plinth where the decades old bronze statue stood before it was vandalised . In the latest demonstration, vandals smeared paint the figure of a young Mohandas Gandhi. Standing in the square in downtown Johannesburg named for Mahatma Gandhi, the memorial marks the Indian anti-colonial leader's time in South Africa, where he formulated the principle of passive resistance. The protester, who smudged white paint on Gandhi's cloak, accused him of being racist during his time in the country. Founding fathers of Afrikaner nationalism were also targeted. In Pretoria, the memorial of 19th century Afrikaner leader Paul Kruger was twice daubed with bright green paint, while the statue of Marthinus Pretorius, who founded the capital city, was splashed with reddish brown paint, according to local media reports. The statue of Louis Botha, the president of the South African Union in the early 1900s, was smeared with red and blue paint outside parliament in Cape Town on the same day that the Rhodes sculpture was removed from its perch overlooking the University of Cape Town after weeks of student protest. In the Free State province, a statue of Boer General Jan Fick was splashed with red paint in the town named after him in 1883, Ficksburg. Another statue is cleaned down after being splashed with green paint on Pretoria's Church Square . Security guards (left) walk past a statue of former South African statesman and Afrikaner leader Louis Botha, which has been defaced with red paint outside the South African parliament building in Cape Town . Several people have been arrested and local authorities have spent thousands of dollars cleaning up the statues.

The senior writer for the Australian Financial Review labelled Anzacs 'racist yobs' The day before Anzac day, Mr Winestock said he hoped 'in 50 years no soldiers around to honour' Both Fairfax and Mr Winestock declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. After a public backlash against McIntyre's comments, SBS Managing Director Michael Ebeid and Director of Sport, Ken Shipp said in a joint statement that his 'highly inappropriate and disrespectful' comments have 'caused his on-air position at SBS to become untenable.' 'Mr McIntyre\u2019s actions have breached the SBS Code of Conduct and social media policy and as a result, SBS has taken decisive action to terminate Mr McIntyre\u2019s position at SBS, with immediate effect.'

In his tweets, the SBS football journalist condemned Anzac day as an 'imperialist invasion.' McIntyre referred to the Anzac's landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey . 'We remember and commemorate our ANZACs': SBS Michael Ebeid was quick to distance the broadcaster from McIntyre's comments on Saturday evening, saying they are 'not at all the views of @SBS' 'The cultification of an imperialist invasion of a foreign nation that Australia had no quarrel with is against all ideals of modern society,' McIntyre tweeted, referring to the Anzac's landing on Turkey's Gallipoli peninsula. In other tweets, the reporter mocked the 'these brave Anzacs' and accused Diggers of committing war crimes. 'Remembering the summary execution, widespread rape and theft committed by these 'brave' Anzacs in Egypt, Palestine and Japan,' he tweeted. 'Wonder if the poorly-read, largely white, nationalist drinkers and gamblers pause today to consider the horror that all mankind suffered. Mr McIntyre has more than 30,000 Twitter followers.

What is perhaps more surprising is their solution to the problem, which involved strapping an old jet engine to the front of a tractor, and using the contraption as a huge leaf-blower. The crew of the Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia's largest warship, came up with the novel idea to help keep the deck clear of debris which poses a major risk to jet planes taking off and landing. Russian sailors on board the Admiral Kuznetsov, the country's largest aircraft carrier, have come up with an inegnious way of cleaning the decks, by strapping an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor . Debris on carrier decks can potentially get sucked into jet engines, so crew are usually required to do manual sweeps of the deck, but the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother . Even a single stray nut or bolt, if sucked into one of the fighter plane's engines, could spell disaster for the pilot, and cause millions of dollars worth of damage. Usually crew members are forced to go around manually checking for stray objects, using sweeper vehicles to help tidy them up. But with 14,700sq ft of deck space to check and recheck every single day, the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother, and took a more direct approach. According to blog Foxtrot Alpha, the sailors have attached an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor, before fitting the front end with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the ship's deck.

What is perhaps more surprising is their solution to the problem, which involved strapping an old jet engine to the front of a tractor, and using the contraption as a huge leaf-blower. The crew of the Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia's largest warship, came up with the novel idea to help keep the deck clear of debris which poses a major risk to jet planes taking off and landing. Russian sailors on board the Admiral Kuznetsov, the country's largest aircraft carrier, have come up with an inegnious way of cleaning the decks, by strapping an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor . Debris on carrier decks can potentially get sucked into jet engines, so crew are usually required to do manual sweeps of the deck, but the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother . Even a single stray nut or bolt, if sucked into one of the fighter plane's engines, could spell disaster for the pilot, and cause millions of dollars worth of damage. Usually crew members are forced to go around manually checking for stray objects, using sweeper vehicles to help tidy them up. But with 14,700sq ft of deck space to check and recheck every single day, the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother, and took a more direct approach. According to blog Foxtrot Alpha, the sailors have attached an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor, before fitting the front end with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the ship's deck.

The massive Kuznetsov is the jewel in President Putin's military fleet, carrying a total of 18 fighter jets and 17 anti-submarine helicopters. The ingenious crew members fitted the old MiG engine with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the deck, and use the contraption like an enormous leaf blower, sending debris overboard . The Kuznetsov has a deck spanning 14,700sqft, so rather than search the entire thing by hand, Russian sailors built themselves a giant leaf-blowing machine instead . Bristling with anti-aircraft cannons, rocket batteries, gatling guns and underwater missiles, it weighs in at 43,000 tons and carries 1,690 crew. However, that is nothing compared to the US Nimitz Class aircraft carriers, the tenth and last of which, the George HW Bush, was commissioned in 2009.

Seven of Slager's fellow cops responded to his call forback-up after the shooting - as handcuffed Walter Scott lay dead or dying with five bullet wounds to the back. But the fact that his wounds were to the back do not feature in subsequent accounts of the shooting given to the media, or in the force's incident report filed after the shooting. Officers also told an internal report that they gave Scott CPR, but the video only shows them checking his pulse and standing over his body. One officer is also present when Slager picks up an object - allegedly his Taser - and puts it near Scott's body. Scroll down for video . Questions: Officer Clarence Haberdashem searches Walter Scott's handcuffed body in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. He later told colleagues that he administered CPR . Scott's father said of the incident: 'It would have never come to light [had video not emerged]. They would have swept it under the rug, like they did with many others.' Slager's former attorney had initially claimed that the officer fired on Scott during a struggle for his Taser and had felt threatened. 'When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser \u2014 as trained by the department \u2014 and then a struggle ensued,' David Aylor said.

Greece this week repeated threats to stop paying off its loan and default on its debt if Europe refuses to release more funds. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors . This would make it harder for the country to remain in the eurozone, although no state has ever left and there is no official exit process. Poul Thomsen, the IMF's Europe Director has been quoted by the Greek media as saying he could not see a successful conclusion to the country's current bail out.

The American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal. Seemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone. At that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' The horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat .

And Rihanna became annoyed in Australia and cut off a chat about her film Battleship when questions began to focus on her love life.

NAOMI CAMPBELL . In April 2010 Naomi Campbell, who is known for her fiery temper, stormed out of an interview with ABC news kicking their camera over on the way. The reporter had asked the supermodel about whether she had received a blood diamond from the deposed Liberian despot Charles Taylor. Naomi said: 'I didn't receive a blood diamond and I'm not going to speak about that.' The interviewer continued to push the 44-year-old until she ended the chat curtly saying: 'Thank you very much,' and walking off. In court Naomi later admitted that she had been given, 'a few dirty rocks,' by Taylor when she testified against him. Robert Pattinson became incredibly awkward whilst, when promoting Twilight: New Moon, he was asked about his relationship with Kristen Stewart . ROBERT PATTINSON .

Yeah about 100, and then I\u2019ve started adding filters these days.' She continued: 'I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only person in the country who has suffered from low self-esteem. 'I know that some of the most beautiful women have got no self-esteem at all and when you\u2019ve got low self-esteem it doesn\u2019t just ruin relationships, it also affects your life. 'I\u2019ve not gone for so many opportunities because I have had such low self-esteem at the time. I\u2019ve been invited to amazing events and I\u2019ve not gone because I\u2019ve couldn\u2019t find anything to wear. Nancy Dell'Olio, 53, puckered up for her close-range selfie .

'No-one should be saying I don\u2019t want to go out because I\u2019m so worried about how I look.' Ms Reid captioned her photo: 'We're encouraging you to post the first unfiltered selfie for @gmb #SelfieEsteem campaign (hair & make-up allowed).\"' MailOnline's US Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan grinned his way through his submission .

She said she didn't know why more than 12 FBI agents and police officers searched her house and confiscated a tablet. The FBI made at least six arrests in Minneapolis and San Diego following a joint terrorism task force operation . The US Attorney's Office and the FBI will hold a news conference Monday to announce details about the joint terrorism task force operation. An FBI spokesman in San Diego referred questions to a spokesman in Minneapolis, who said Sunday he could not comment. Authorities say a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants within the last year. At least one Minnesotan has died while fighting for the Islamic State. Since 2007, more than 22 young Somali men have also traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the terrorist group al-Shabab. Four Minnesotans have already been charged in connection with supporting terror groups in Syria, including ISIS.", "filter_p": 1}

Millwall: Forde (c); Cummings, Nelson, Beevers, Harding; Upson, Abdou, Williams (Bailey 42), Martin (Gueye 68); O\u2019Brien (Woolford 84), Gregory . Substitutes not used: Archer (GK); Cowan-Hall, Fuller, Taylor-Fletcher . Scorers: Abdou 75; Gueye 90+3 . Booked: Gregory, Martin, Bailey, Beevers . Sent off: Upson . Wigan Athletic: Carson; Boyce, Maguire, Pearce, Bong; Pennant (Chow 81), Perch (c), Kvist (Ojo 90+1), Kim Bo-Kyung, McLean; Fortune (Waghorn 53) Substitutes not used: Al Habsi (GK); McCann, Barnett, Murphy . Booked: Bong, Bo-Kyung . Sent off: Waghorn, Pearson . Referee: Stephen Martin (Staffordshire) In his six seasons at the club, that was only Abdou\u2019s seventh goal. What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn\u2019t a misprint. There was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O\u2019Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall\u2019s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction. The game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm. And a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson. Millwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night. The plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points. Harris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.

The popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell. But for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters. The child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground . At least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. It is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time. A large amount of research, according to Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors.

Asked what she would do if Mr Farage asked her to 'carry on the mantle', Miss Evans today told Murnaghan on Sky News: 'Well if he said that to me, of course I would, yes. 'But he\u2019s going to win and I cannot wait to see him in the House of Commons, he will really shake things up, it is a very exciting prospect.' Miss Evans, who is the party's deputy chairman, down-played Mr Farage's medical problems.

In pain: Ukip leader Nigel Farage is suffering from a recurring spinal injury and is on medication . Miss Evans is seen as the party's rising star and has been increasingly tipped as Mr Farage's successor because of strong media performances. She wrote the party's general election manifesto. After the manifesto launch, she was praised for her assured and confident performance and she received Mr Farage\u2019s personal thanks. In January she stepped in as policy chief after Tim Aker quit amid reports he was failing to deliver it on time. Miss Evans, who is a former BBC local radio journalist, works freelance as a PR and marketing consultant and in 2011 founded a health charity for women. In May 2013 she came to prominence when she defected from the Tories to Ukip with a group of councillors in Merton, south London, but she lost her seat in local election last year. She is regularly used by the party for appearances on programmes such as Question Time and Newsnight, and has been fronting the party\u2019s election campaign morning press conferences. But despite increasing talk about her leadership potential, senior Ukip figures privately admit she is unlikely to be elected in Shrewsbury & Atcham, the Shropshire seat where she is standing to become MP.

Critics have accused Labour of being bound by its union paymasters after the party unveiled policies including raising corporation tax, introducing a mansion tax, repealing the benefits cap, nationalising the railways and scrapping employment tribunal fees. Since Mr Miliband became party leader, thanks largely to union backing, nearly \u00a37 in every \u00a310 donated to Labour has come from the unions \u2013 amounting to more than \u00a340million. In the first round of election donations registered, \u00a3506,240 was given by Unison, while the CWU gave \u00a351,072.

In the week to April 5, the Conservatives received \u00a3501,850 and the Lib Dems \u00a320,000. One of the most generous gifts to the Tories \u2013 \u00a375,000 \u2013 came from Michael Tory, who was in charge of Lehman Brothers\u2019 UK investment banking division when the bank nearly crashed the West\u2019s economy. Sawsan Asfari, wife of long-time Tory donor and oil executive Ayman Asfari, gave \u00a320,000.

Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her, but now the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Scroll down for video . Green party leader Natalie Bennett has distanced herself from the bizarre blog posts of her boyfriend Jim Jepps, insisting he is a 'private individual not involved in party politics' Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. However, little is known about her private life, in contrast to the spouses of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail. Ms Bennett has been dating Mr Jepps for five years, after meeting online. He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011. He quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens.

Reading are striving to make the FA Cup final for the first time in their history, leading to excitement understandably building in Berkshire - if not the club's Hogwood Park training ground.

It has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup . 'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said. 'They're winning games. 'They have terrific players. Great problems for us to solve. 'Maybe they have left their run too late to catch Chelsea at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly.'

It has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup . 'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said. 'They're winning games. 'They have terrific players. Great problems for us to solve. 'Maybe they have left their run too late to catch Chelsea at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly.'

Clarke, a winner as player and coach at Chelsea, has told his players not to get caught up in the occasion, with progression the only objective. 'I think when you go through to semi-finals, the only way to enjoy it is to win the game,' the Reading manager said. 'You can't go to Wembley and play the occasion. It is not about playing the occasion, we're playing Arsenal. 'For us, it has to be a day of work. We have to go there focused only on what happens on the pitch.

But England coach Roy Hodgson has kept faith with the 21-year-old and Martinez believes his two substitute appearances for England against Lithuania and Italy over the past week have shown that the midfielder is ready to kick on again. Roberto Martinez is backing Ross Barkley to become an even more influential player for Everton and England . Barkley impressed after coming off the substitutes bench during England's 1-1 draw in Turin . Martinez said: 'Ross is a young man but he is used to having to deal with extremes. When he plays well he is probably the best footballer England has. When he has a bad game it\u2019s the end of the world. 'He has achieved an incredible level of maturity this season. 'He had to go through a period of difficulty the same way we have as a team and I think he has learned a lot. 'It doesn\u2019t surprise me, he has had a big impact when he came on in both games with England. He was ready to do that. Barkley replaced Theo Walcott in the second half and looked bright as the Three Lions earned a draw . The 21-year-old celebrates after scoring for Everton during their 3-0 victory against Newcastle . 'He will benefit from the experiences of this difficult season. This is his second full season in an important role in the squad. He enjoys that responsibility and taking responsibility in big games. 'He has an incredible technical ability and, with the physicality he has, you don\u2019t see many players in world football with those capabilities. 'We know who Ross is and how important he is for the future of Everton.\u201d Everton\u2019s struggles this season have seen them flirt with relegation and although wins over Newcastle and QPR have eased their plight, Martinez insists guaranteeing safety is still their only immediate target going into Saturday\u2019s visit of sixth-placed Southampton. Martinez insists guaranteeing safety is still Everton's only immediate target ahead of Saturday's match . The Everton boss added: 'There\u2019s no distraction from our league position. That\u2019s everything that matters. 'Those two wins have given us a real sense of confidence and belief for what\u2019s in front of us. 'Forty points is still the target. Nothing has changed until we achieve that and then we will try and get as high up the table as we can.' Top scorer Romelu Lukaku will face a fitness test on the hamstring injury that kept him out of Belgium\u2019s internationals but midfielder Darron Gibson is expected to be fit to face the Saints. Wingers Kevin Mirallas and Steven Pienaar have also recovered from injury and could be included. Top scorer Romelu Lukaku (centre) will face a fitness test on his hamstring injury .", "filter_p": 1}

A burglar who broke into a young teacher's home and sexually assaulted her as she lay in bed has been freed by a judge who handed him a community sentence. The decision's been slammed by a Victim Support charity worker, who said that 'victims deserve justice', after the 24-year-old teacher was left traumatised by the ordeal. Judge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' during the case at Birmingham Crown Court, which has left her 'petrified' and afraid to go out. But Joshua Sweet, 20, from Birmingham, was freed and given a three-year community order on account of an early plea and having spent just two months in jail awaiting his court appearance. Madhu Rai, prosecuting, said Sweet broke into the victim's home and took items including car keys and a mobile phone before making his way upstairs, where the victim was asleep. In the dead of night, she awoke to find the intruder 'standing beside her bed' and screamed, which is when the terrifying assault began. Sweet then rolled down her duvet and touched the defendant sexually, saying 'you're not going to make any noise are you?'

For de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age.

At the moment, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Hydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily . Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention. It uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. Lead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces. Water splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively. The energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two. The new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process. It can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner. The process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost. With this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency. \u2018Oxygen is the most difficult bit,\u2019 Dr Hintermair explained. Their catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn\u2019t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is \u2018almost non-existent\u2019. The major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar. \u2018We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can\u2019t store it very well,\u2019 Dr Hintermair continued. \u2018We can put it in a battery but you can\u2019t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet. \u2018So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.\u2019 This, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical.

A student who tried to cheat his way to a better degree by hacking into the university computers and changing his marks has been jailed. Imran Uddin, 25, who was studying science, bought keyboard spying equipment on the internet which he then connected to a number of university computers. Through the software, which recorded key strokes, he was able to find out the passwords that staff were typing in to log in to the computers. He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself. After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments. On one paper, he upped his mark from 57 per cent, a lower second grade, to 73 per cent, a first. He carried out his plot using keyboard \u2018shadowing\u2019 devices which look like a USB stick and can be bought for as little as \u00a349 on the internet. He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying. The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course. At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree. He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act. Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018For reasons not entirely clear to me, whether it was monetary, or pride, or a desire to outperform others, you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that. I consider your actions were planned and persistent.\u2019 He warned that Uddin\u2019s behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system. The judge added that he felt compelled to put Uddin behind bars as a \u2018deterrence\u2019 to others. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018This kind of conduct undermines, or has the potential to undermine, public confidence in the degree system, set up by this university. I have decided I cannot pass a suspended sentence because there needs to be an element of deterrence.\u2019 Uddin was found out after staff discovered the devices when several computers were upgraded on October 7 last year. When they removed the protective casing from the computers in the bio-science building, the spying devices were discovered. Staff then began checking other university computer equipment and a further three spying devices were found.

A student who tried to cheat his way to a better degree by hacking into the university computers and changing his marks has been jailed. Imran Uddin, 25, who was studying science, bought keyboard spying equipment on the internet which he then connected to a number of university computers. Through the software, which recorded key strokes, he was able to find out the passwords that staff were typing in to log in to the computers. He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself. After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments. On one paper, he upped his mark from 57 per cent, a lower second grade, to 73 per cent, a first. He carried out his plot using keyboard \u2018shadowing\u2019 devices which look like a USB stick and can be bought for as little as \u00a349 on the internet. He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying. The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course. At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree. He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act. Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018For reasons not entirely clear to me, whether it was monetary, or pride, or a desire to outperform others, you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that. I consider your actions were planned and persistent.\u2019 He warned that Uddin\u2019s behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system. The judge added that he felt compelled to put Uddin behind bars as a \u2018deterrence\u2019 to others. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018This kind of conduct undermines, or has the potential to undermine, public confidence in the degree system, set up by this university. I have decided I cannot pass a suspended sentence because there needs to be an element of deterrence.\u2019 Uddin was found out after staff discovered the devices when several computers were upgraded on October 7 last year.
