Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. \"My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),\" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. \"It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner.\" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical.

That is exactly what retailer Vestiaire Collective is hoping for, as they put a Hermes bag on sale for a cool \u00a3140,000 on their site. Is this Britain's most expensive handbag? A sade-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag embellished with rubies has gone on sale for \u00a3140,000 . So what do you get for your money? The made-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag comes embellished with rubies. The rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store and experts say it's an extremely good investment. Fanny Moizant, Vestiaire Collective's Brand Communications Director and Head of UK, said: 'Hermes Birkin bags have come to symbolise the epitome of quality, the materials and the impeccable French craftsmanship are second to none. 'The brand has a strong heritage with a controlled supply, which makes it highly desirable for stylish women. This aspirational identity has developed into a strong social status symbol. The limited supply and production of rare colours and skin have made these bags must-have collectors items resulting in an increased value over time, unlike cars, which are known to depreciate in value after leaving the showroom.'

Prestigious luggage and accessories firm Herm\u00e9s, who count many of the world's wealthiest women as fans, is known for luxury leather accessories. Renowned for its immaculate finish and top quality materials, Herm\u00e8s claims never to use any assembly lines with one craftsperson making a single handbag at a time, hand-stitching individual pieces to create the finished product. The brand is rich in history, and some of its bestselling bags have intriguing stories behind them. The iconic Kelly bag, one of Hermes most popular styles, was originally known as the Sac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches when it was developed by Hermes in 1935. In 1956, a photo of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of Monaco, was pictured carrying the Sac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches to hide her pregnancy. Photographs were sent all over the world and put on the cover of Life magazine. As a result, the bag became known as the Kelly and has been hugely popular ever since.

Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the attack on a Top Gear producer which led to him being sacked from the hit BBC show. Police had opened an investigation into the incident, which took place at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire last month after Clarkson had been filming Top Gear in the area. However, after the victim Oisin Tymon said that he did not want to press charges, officers have now decided to drop the probe without taking action against Clarkson. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: \u2018North Yorkshire Police has now completed its routine enquiries following the incident at Hawes involving Mr Jeremy Clarkson, and we will not be pursuing this matter any further. \u2018North Yorkshire Police takes a thorough and victim-led approach to all investigations. \u2018Last week, the person at the centre of the incident, Mr Tymon, said that he did not wish the police to take action on his behalf. \u2018However, at that point we still needed to speak to some members of the public who were present at the time of the incident, who had been affected by the event, and whose views also needed to be considered. \u2018Now that all the interviews are complete, we have properly established that there is no need for further police action.\u2019 The incident, described as a 'fracas' by BBC officials, occurred when Clarkson discovered that the hotel where he was staying could not serve him a hot meal following a day's filming. An official report found that the 54-year-old presenter punched Mr Tymon in the mouth before being dragged away by a witness, causing the producer to go to A&E for emergency treatment. He also verbally abused him for 20 minutes, blaming Mr Tymon for failing to ensure that he could get a steak at the hotel. Victim: Oisin Tymon told police he did not wish to press charges against Mr Clarkson . Mr Clarkson was suspended as Top Gear presenter as soon as news of the fight came to light, and after the report was released the BBC announced that it would not renew his contract. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately, and the producer told North Yorkshire Police he did not want to see Mr Clarkson prosecuted. Despite his sacking, Mr Clarkson is set to take part in a series of Top Gear Live shows alongside co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May, although the performances will be rebranded. The BBC has said that Top Gear is likely to continue in some form, but Mr Hammond and Mr May are not expected to return. The star initially received widespread public support - including from his friend, Prime Minister David Cameron - in the aftermath of the incident, while one million people signed a petition calling for the BBC to reinstate him.

Resplendent in an edgy navy leather jacket and a matching tailored dress, the 37-year-old was all smiles as she presented tennis ace Novak Djokovic with his Sportsman of the Year prize. The presentation of the award, which was bestowed on Djokovic by the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, came during the Laureus World Sports Awards. Scroll down for video . Princess with prizes: Charlene allows herself a chuckle as she hands the award to Novak Djokovic . Although the main ceremony took place in Shanghai, Charlene's star turn took place in Monte Carlo instead, with the moment projected onto big screens in front of a glitzy audience of actors and sports stars. Among the big names celebrating with Djokovic, albeit from a distance, were actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Henry Cavill and model Karolina Kurkova. While Cumberbatch, who was hosting the main event, and 31-year-old Cavill have no clear links to sport, Charlene's own sporting pedigree is impeccable. A successful swimmer, she burst onto the scene in 1999 at the All Africa Games in Johannesburg where she picked up three golds and a silver for her native South Africa. Glamorous gathering: The 37-year-old royal cut an elegant figure during the presentation ceremony . Sporting pedigree: Charlene has an impressive sporting pedigree of her own and was an Olympic swimmer . Chuffed: Mr Djokovic looked suitably thrilled with his Sportsman of the Year award . She went on to compete in the 2000 Olympics but narrowly missed out on the 2008 event after spending 18 months out with shoulder injury. Since marrying Monaco's Prince Albert in July 2011, she has used her position to promote a number of sporting initiatives via the Princess Charlene Foundation. Of these, the best known is a programme that encourages children to learn to swim, while emphasising water safety. Today's outing, for the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, dovetails with her own charitable ambitions and promotes excellence in sport, as well as positive social change. Now a mother to four-month-old twins Gabriella Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Marie and Jacques Honor\u00e9 Rainier, Charlene is attending fewer engagements than previously but remains a familiar sight at sporting events. Surprise guests: Mr Cavill and Mr Cumberbatch chat while showing their support for the sporting event . Roles: Mr Cavill's new film Superman vs. Batman isn't far off, while Mr Cumberbatch is prepping for Hamlet . Adding some glamour: Model Karolina Kurkova and Paralympic cycling star Sarah Storey .

Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. \"My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,\" Klitschko told CNN. \"I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. \"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. \"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said. \"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want. \"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and Summarize the article in three sentences. Summary:"}

Amjad Yaaqub, 16, said he stumbled on the barbaric scene shortly after the terrorists beat him unconscious when they burst into his family home at the camp in the Syrian capital Damascus. The schoolboy said the ISIS fighters were looking for his brother, who is a member of the Palestinian rebel group who ran and defended the camp for several years before ISIS carried out a bloody assault that has left more than 200 people dead in just seven days. His story was revealed as refugees in Yarmouk spoke of the daily atrocities they have witnessed since ISIS seized control of 90 per cent of the camp, including innocent children being slaughtered in front of their anguished parents. Scroll down for video . Scene of death: A destroyed graveyard is photographed in Yarmouk camp following the intense fighting . Innocent: Palestinians, who fled the Yarmouk refugee camp, sit on mattresses inside a school in Damascus . After enduring two years of famine and fighting, Ibrahim Abdel Fatah said he saw heads cut off by ISIS in the Palestinian camp of Yarmouk. That was it. He fled and hasn't looked back. Unshaven, pale and gaunt, he has found refuge with his wife and seven children at the Zeinab al-Haliyeh school in Tadamun, a southeastern district of the Syrian capital held by the army. 'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised,' he said. 'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved,' the 55-year-old said. The school is currently home to 98 displaced people, among them 40 children, who have been put up in three classrooms. The usual occupants, schoolchildren, have been evacuated temporarily from rooms where mattresses and bedding now blanket the floor. 'I left my house which was the only thing I had. My family lived on rations supplied by UNRWA,' the United Nations agency that looks after Palestinian refugees, the former caretaker said.

A man stands on a staircase inside a demolished building inside the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp . Anwar Abdel Hadi, a Palestine Liberation Organisation official in Damascus, said 500 families, or about 2,500 people, fled Yarmouk before IS fighters attacked the camp last Wednesday. Before the assault, there were around 18,000 people in Yarmouk in a southern neighbourhood of the Syrian capital. Yarmouk was once a thriving district housing 160,000 Palestinian refugees and Syrians. But that was before it too was caught up in the widespread civil unrest which erupted in 2011.

His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.\u2019 Charlie\u2019s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents\u2019 home in Summarize the article in three sentences.

They would play for 'Team South' - comprised of stars from La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1 - against a similar 'North' dream team from the Premier League, Bundesliga and Russian Premier League. Mundo Deportivo report that a marketing company has approached UEFA and proposed the annual fixture, which is inspired by the NBA All-Star Game between the Western and Eastern Conferences. Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo report that an All-Star match has been proposed that would bring together the cream of European talent - including Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi (pictured) The proposals raise the tantalising prospect of club rivals Messi and Ronaldo playing on the same team . Messi and Ronaldo would be the star attractions in the 'North vs South' All-Star fixture . South: Buffon; Danilo, Sergio Ramos, Pique, Thiago Silva; Messi, Pogba, Koke, Neymar; Cristiano Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic . North: Neuer; Terry, Hummels, Alaba; Robben, Di Maria, Silva, Reus; Alexis, Aguero, Hazard . The players involved would be chosen by an online fan poll, with no more than three players from any club side. But despite such restrictions, the proposed match would throw up the tantalising prospect of Barcelona;s Messi and Neymar joining forces with Real Madrid stars Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Other possible stars in the 'South' team include Paris Saint-Germain forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba. The 'North' side could feature Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero, Chelsea's Eden Hazard, Manchester United winger Angel di Maria and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar could also feature in the proposed All-Star match . Zlatan Ibrahimovic would likely lead the line for the 'South' Europe dream team in the game . Chelsea's Eden Hazard could be a star turn for the 'North' select XI . Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero would likely be included in the 'North' team . See what happened in our North England vs South England Premier League clash simulated by Football Manager . The fixture would naturally draw a massive audience all around the world and the television and sponsorship rights commanded would ensure a nice payday for UEFA and the company involved. However, there would inevitably be a number of hurdles to overcome to get such a project off the ground and some clubs are likely to be unhappy about releasing their players for the game.

Scroll down for video . Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was a dominant and influential airline which declared bankruptcy and ceased operations in 1991 . Many of the adverts in the book featured beautiful women in an effort to glamorise destinations and encourage people to travel . British Airways promoted its launch of the Concorde in the 1970s (left) while Trans World Airlines (TWA) promoted its New York route . Authored by Matthias C Huhne, the 436-page book contains dozens of glamorous adverts that encouraged those who could afford to fly to visit far-flung destinations such as Haiti, Hawaii, Japan, New York and London. The simple but effective posters showcase each destination with eye-catching cartoons or photos of beautiful women, landmarks such as Times Square and Tower of London, and natural beauty spots including Bermuda\u2019s picturesque coastline and Sydney Harbour. New York was one of the most popular destinations featured in the adverts in Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 . The adverts were created for the biggest airlines of the day, including TWA and Canadian Pacific, which no longer exist .

Above, he wrote that the Leibniz notation was 'extremely difficult' It was written at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and paved the way for computer science. It is believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript known to exist, the auctioneer said. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, said: 'Alan Turing was a war hero, who broke the Enigma code helping to bring an end to World War II, the father of modern computing science, and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result. 'His impact on our everyday lives is enormous, and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling.' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said . Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests . The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results . Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' In a statement through Bonhams, Turing scholar Andrew Hodges said the notebook sheds more light on how Turing 'remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' He added: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value.' Turing committed suicide in 1954. He was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Britain and was convicted of indecency in 1952.

The 59-year-old told police the injuries were caused when she fell and said he had accidentally 'caught her face' when he went to catch her in November last year. He was arrested after the victim's carer returned home and called the police. His mother later told detectives: 'He just blew up. 'He was pushing my face and holding my wrists. I can remember I said: \"Stop this Tim, don't do it\".' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey. A forensic psychologist told the court that emotionally damaged Norris-Jones looked to his mother for support and 'lost his rag' when she could not provide it. Judge Noel Lucas, sentencing, branded the attack 'horrific' and added: 'It is pretty unforgivable to strike an elderly lady.' He said: 'You gave your mother a systematic beating. 'If I had taken the view that your actions were anything other than those of an ill and weak man, I would now be sending you to prison for a substantial amount of time.'

Vanessa Favia, attorney for 19-year-old Heather Mack, has filed court documents for her client agreeing to turn over funds for the care of four-month-old Stella. CBS reports the petition asks for around a half a million dollars to be transferred to Stella, who was born in Kerobakan Prison and who has urgent needs, including clothing and baby wipes. Scroll down for video . Child care: A US-based attorney for Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murdering her socialite mother in Bali, has filed for about half a million dollars to be transferred to Mack's daughter Stella from Mack's trust fund . Heather Mack smiles at her baby daughter Stella before her sentencing hearing in Denpasar, Bali, in March . Mack wept as prosecutors said she should be sentenced to 15 years - but spared her the death penalty . 'What ever your opinion of the adults in this case, I believe everyone would agree that the baby bears no culpability in this truly sad affair,' Favia said in a press release. Mack filed a claim in court back in February that her uncle, Wiese-Mack's brother and trustee of her estate, had blocked her access to the funds, according to NBC. A judge ordered $150,000 be released to pay for Mack's defense, along with another $2,240 for living expenses, but required that Mack not share the money with anyone. Indonesian officials accused Mack of helping her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, murder her mother at a luxury Bali hotel before stuffing her body in a suitcase last August. The pair are awaiting sentencing, with prosecutors having asked for a sentence of 15 years for Mack and 18 for Schaefer. Chief Prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya said Mack 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother,' but wanted her to be spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby.' The 21-year-old gazes at his baby daughter, held by a relative, before his sentence demand hearing . Mack claimed her daughter - who had to return to hospital shortly after her birth with jaundice - has six fingers on her left hand . Since being held in jail, the 19-year-old from Chicago has been keeping her newborn Stella with her in the crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison. In a bizarre comment from her holding cell last week, Mack said with a grin that Stella has six fingers on her left hand, saying, 'But don't worry, she's OK, thank you.' As she waited in the cell, nervously puffing on a cigarette, Mack added that she and her co-accused boyfriend were married 'in spirit.' She said: 'He has made us a ring each to wear from his side of the prison.' She held up a hand revealing a red plastic ring. 'Tommy's is blue,' she added.

This weekend saw its TV channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene. This no doubt will have the purists, and perhaps even some fans of the four teams involved, spitting at the very mention. But with Wembley on board for both games, I doubt the BBC and BT Sport will have minded presenting their coverage from HQ. However, on Saturday evening, Ian Wright was dead sheepish about it in the BBC\u2019s on-site studio. \u2018I don\u2019t like semi finals at Wembley\u2019, said Wrighty squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it. Well, some twenty four hour or so later, Wembley was certainly delighted to host them. Arsenal players celebrate during the victory over Reading which saw the Gunners reach the FA Cup final . Fabian Delph (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Liverpool at Wembley . Wembley Stadium was a great setting for this weekend's two FA Cup semi-final clashes . Prior to that first clash on Saturday between Arsenal and Reading, there had also been disgruntled talk from inside the Emirates Stadium. This time about the fact the match clashed with the big Premier league game between Chelsea and Manchester United. Yes, over on Sky Sports, you could have witnessed business as usual at Stamford Bridge. With a first half that Jamie Redknapp at one point described as \u2018difficult to watch\u2019. If you weren\u2019t watching Chelsea's victory, what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event, a real footballing occasion.

Edinson Cavani, pictured celebrating a goal against Chelsea, is a target for Manchester United this summer . Cavani protests with the referee during PSG's Ligue 1 fixture against Marseille at the weekend . He told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'Is Cavani on the market? At this point it's a little early to say. 'Edi is under contract at Paris Saint-Germain and there are several factors that come into play with respect to his future.' Once the situation is clarified there are several different scenarios given that players like him, at his level of maturity, are coveted by the biggest clubs in Europe. 'The market would seem to suggest Spain or England - we can't say at the present time that an Italian club could participate in the bidding for Cavani. United could make a move for PSG striker Edinson Cavani (right) when the transfer window reopens . 'However, we must remain alert to the developing situation at Milan and the recent change of ownership at Valencia.' Cavani is reportedly fed up of playing second fiddle to Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the French capital, often shunted out wide to get the best out of the Swedish striker. But PSG may want to keep hold of Cavani as they are unsure about Ibrahimovic's future at the club. United are thought to be interested in Cavani to replace Robin van Persie, with Juventus and Inter Milan eyeing the ageing forward.

So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said.

In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for Summarize the article in three sentences. Summary:"}

The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.

There is almost nothing in Michael Thomas Slager's police personnel file to suggest that his bosses considered him a rogue officer capable of murdering a man he just pulled over for a broken tail light. People in the community he served say this reflects what's going wrong with policing today: Officers nearly always get the last word when citizens complain. Scroll down for video . Residents of the Charleston, South Carolina, have said the shooting of unarmed black driver Walter Scott was preceded by previous unheeded complaints about the police. Above, a friend of Scott's at a memorial . The officer who shot Scott, Michael Slager, had little in his file to suggest excessive force. Above, two men pray at the memorial . 'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday. The mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases. Nationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said. 'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.' Both Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence. Video captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away . Original statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident . A dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light . Slager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police.

After surgery, the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened, and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning. For some women, the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent, which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects \u2013 including complete hair loss, nausea, sickness, weight gain or loss, and extreme fatigue \u2013 can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself. But experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest of the tests, called EndoPredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy. Most of the tests are available only privately and cost about \u00a32,500, although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the NHS. Surgeon Hemant Singhal said: 'I think there is a good case for the NHS to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy.' Professor Kefah Mokbel, consultant breast surgeon at St George's Hospital, London, said: 'With this test we can help patients make an informed choice, whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone.' Becca Cornford, a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11, six and four, was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence . She said: 'I dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy. I was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children.' Professor Mokbel operated on Becca in December at the Princess Grace Hospital, London, and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the EndoPredict. A low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds. 'I could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return,' she says. 'There is no treatment that places your chances at zero. But if you have regular monitoring, there is every chance that any cancer that might come back would be nipped in the bud early.' Summarize the article in three sentences. Summary:"}

The deputies were trying to arrest Harris when Reserve Deputy Robert Bates shot him. Unlike Bates, they are not charged with a crime, but have come under criticism for pinning Harris' head to the ground as he said, \"I'm losing my breath.\" Police appear on video saying, \"F*ck your breath,\" apparently in response. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify the nature of the threats, but said he was \"very concerned\" for their safety and that of their families. He did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do. Another sheriff's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency's drug unit pending the review of the April 2 shooting of Harris following a weapons sting. Glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions, saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving Bates has been settled. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris' death. Bates, who is free on $25,000 bond pending trial, shot Harris with his handgun after calling out, \"Taser, Taser,\" -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue Harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies. Amid questions about his age -- 73 -- training and friendship with Glanz, Bates has said the shooting was accidental, and has apologized to the family. Lawyer releases training records for Tulsa deputy charged in killing . On Monday, Glanz also apologized to Harris' family. \"We are sorry Eric was taken from you,\" he said. But he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing, and said Monday that the FBI had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. Bates is white. Harris was black. There have been allegations, first reported by the Tulsa World newspaper, that some of Bates' training records had been forged, or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force. The sheriff denied those allegations, saying he was certain Bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training. He said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records, and said he had not issued any training waivers for Bates, with whom he has been friends for more than two decades. But he said he supported prosecutor's decision to proceed with the case. He also said he had brought in a Dallas police consultant who had previously examined the office's policies and procedures for another look.

The Croatian midfielder pulled up in the second half against Malaga on Saturday and tests on Sunday confirmed a sprained ligament in his right knee with a recovery time of between five and six weeks. The news comes as the club wait to assess the full extent of Gareth Bale's calf injury, picked up in the same game. The connection between the former Tottenham pair is an essential part of Carlo Ancelotti's side's chances of picking up silverware this season. Former Tottenham midfielder Luka Modric is helped off the Bernabeu pitch by medical staff . Cristiano Ronaldo was the first Madrid player to go over to Gareth Bale, who picked up an injury on Saturday . Luka Modric hobbles off the Bernabeu pitch have sprained a ligament in his right knee on Saturday . Modric could still be back for the Champions League final but Real Madrid will have to get there without him. On Wednesday when they play the second leg of their quarter-final against Atletico Madrid, poised at 0-0 after the first 90 minutes, they will almost certainly also be without Bale. It\u2019s one year on from his dramatic winner in the Copa del Rey final but Bale, who also scored in the Champions League final and the World Club Cup last year, is likely to be in a race to get back before the Champions League semi-finals on 5-6 May should Real reach them. Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu on Saturday evening . Real Madrid will have Karim Benzema back against Atletico so he will partner Crisitano Ronaldo up front with James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Isco plus whoever Ancelotti calls upon to replace Modric in a midfield four. German international Sami Khedira and former Real Sociedad player Asier Illaramendi are the options. Bale\u2019s absence will be a massive blow for Ancelotti. He said in midweek: \u2018Bale was fantastic last season and has been very good this year. He scored goals in the finals last season and he will be important for us as this season reaches its climax.\u2019 And most Real Madrid supporters see Modric as even more important to the team. The Croatian injured himself towards the end of last year and when he missed three months of football it coincided with the team\u2019s worst run of form. The Welsh forward was forced off and faces a race to be fit for Real's Champions League quarter-final . The Spanish press reacts to Real Madrid's injury 'crisis' having beaten Malaga 3-1 on Saturday . Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after securing the 3-1 victory late on against Malaga on Saturday .

There has been plenty of speculation about the Belgium international and he even admitted himself in February he fancied a new challenge and had an ambition to play in the Champions League next season. Injuries have prevented the 27-year-old from really finding his best form this campaign with a run of consistent performances but Martinez was delighted to see him score his first Premier League goal since December 28 in last weekend's win over Burnley. Kevin Mirallas has been linked with a move away from Everton following an injury-hit term at the Toffees . Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits to not knowing what the future holds for his Belgian star . There were reports this week Tottenham would try to make the forward part of a swap deal with their winger Aaron Lennon, who is currently on loan at Goodison Park. However, Martinez backed Mirallas to put the continuing debate about his future to one side. 'The total honest truth is we don't know what is going to happen in the future,' he said. 'I heard somewhere that he had one year left and it was a bit of an unsettled situation but that is not the case, he has two years left. 'I don't think it has ever been an issue.

'He is someone who takes responsibility on the pitch, wants to make things happen and scoring the goal was an important moment. 'Kevin has always been a really hard-working player day-to-day and I have seen him progressing but I have never seen an issue in his performances at all. 'The way he performed on Saturday showed that. In every window you have to sit down and make sure everyone who is fully committed is ready to be part of the future.

Downton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body\u2019s management board ahead of their spring meeting today. The decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England\u2019s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just \u2018too accident prone\u2019. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . It was Downton who took the huge call to sack Kevin Pietersen and then re-appointed Peter Moores, calling him \u2018the outstanding coach of his generation\u2019. He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain. Former England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate. Ultimately it was England\u2019s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton. \u2018The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,\u2019 said Harrison in an ECB statement. \u2018The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.\u2019 Michael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton . Vaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender . That new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector. That makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today\u2019s board meeting at Lord\u2019s. Yet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves. \u2018This doesn\u2019t impact on Peter Moores\u2019 position at all,\u2019 Harrison said later on Sky. \u2018This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.\u2019 Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing .

Memorials to South Africa's colonial past were defaced by mainly young black protesters as statues of British monarchs Queen Victoria and King George V were splashed with paint in the cities of Port Elizabeth and Durban respectively. Vandals poured paint over Scottish-South African missionary Andrew Murray's statue in the Western Cape. War memorials were also defaced. A bronze rider marking the Anglo-Boer War from 1899 to 1902, was toppled from his horse. Object of anger: This statue of Queen Victoria outside the Port Elizabeth city library in South Africa is among a number of memorials to British colonials that have been vandalised during protests against 'racist' figures .

Instead, every culture, every generation, remakes Jesus in its own image. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed savior when America was mostly Anglo-Protestant, at least in Hollywood's eyes. An androgynous, meek-and-mild messiah during the anything-goes 1970s. A studly action-figure hero after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Flip through the gallery above, and you'll see what I mean. If you turned on the television this past Sunday, though, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal. If not following all of history's clues -- Hollywood has yet to cast an actual Jew as Jesus -- then at least inching closer. Flipping through the channels on a day millions of Western Christians celebrated the resurrection of their savior, viewers could choose from \"Killing Jesus,\" a NatGeo production rebroadcast Sunday on Fox. \"A.D.,\" NBC's sequel to the blockbuster miniseries \"The Bible,\" and \"Finding Jesus,\" CNN's addition to the ever-burgeoning body of Christ-centered TV fare. Does God have a prayer in Hollywood? What unites these disparate projects, besides a recognition that Jesus always draws an audience and the Good Book is good for business, is the type of men chosen to play Christ. They are brawny, with brown eyes and dark complexions. They look like men who could be carpenters, if not in Nazareth, than at least in the Mediterranean neighborhood. Haaz Sleiman, from \"Killing Jesus,\" was born and raised in Lebanon. He's also Muslim, a fact that annoyed some Christians, who took to Twitter to voice their displeasure. Adam Bond, a British actor of mixed heritage, including Native American, portrays Jesus during the historical reenactments in \"Finding Jesus.\" And Juan Pablo Di Pace -- a Argentinian named after the late St. Pope John Paul II -- takes a starring role in \"A.D.,\" replacing Diogo Morgado, dubbed \"hot Jesus,\" by some, \"smarmy Jesus\" by others. You could make the case that authenticity is the coin of our current entertainment realm, and that filmmakers are competing to make their work as historically accurate as possible. Contemporary viewers are too savvy to stomach the fake beards and odd accents that littered the camels-and-sandals epics of eras past. But there's another, deeper meaning behind our new, multicultural Jesuses, scholars say. \"Filmmakers and networks are in touch with the fact that the complexion of America has changed,\" said Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, a religion scholar and author of \"Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ.\" \"A large number of Americans are people of color: Latinos and Middle Easterners and people from India,\" Humphries-Books continued. \"That means the audience base is shifting in various and important ways.\" The audience base may be shifting, but it's also tuning in.

Seven of Slager's fellow cops responded to his call forback-up after the shooting - as handcuffed Walter Scott lay dead or dying with five bullet wounds to the back. But the fact that his wounds were to the back do not feature in subsequent accounts of the shooting given to the media, or in the force's incident report filed after the shooting. Officers also told an internal report that they gave Scott CPR, but the video only shows them checking his pulse and standing over his body. One officer is also present when Slager picks up an object - allegedly his Taser - and puts it near Scott's body. Scroll down for video . Questions: Officer Clarence Haberdashem searches Walter Scott's handcuffed body in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. He later told colleagues that he administered CPR . Scott's father said of the incident: 'It would have never come to light [had video not emerged]. They would have swept it under the rug, like they did with many others.' Slager's former attorney had initially claimed that the officer fired on Scott during a struggle for his Taser and had felt threatened. 'When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser \u2014 as trained by the department \u2014 and then a struggle ensued,' David Aylor said. 'The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. [He] felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.' On Wednesday North Charleston Mayor Keith Sumney refused to answer a question on Slager's fellow officers' culpability, saying it would be addressed in the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division [SLED] investigation. There are also questions over discrepancies between responding officers' version of events in an internal incident report and what the witness video shows. It is not known what accounts those officers gave to the subsequent SLED investigation. The video of the shooting shows Officer Clarence Haberdasham was the first to arrive on scene as Scott lay handcuffed on the ground. As Haberdasham arrives, Slager runs back to position where he fired the fatal shots and appears to retrieve a dark object - claimed to be his Taser - and places it next to Scott's body. Haberdasham dons a pair of blue gloves, checks Scott's pulse, goes through his pockets and speaks on his radio and then walks away. Radio records show that an officer reported that Scott had gunshot wounds to the chest and right side and was 'unresponsive'. He later added that the vicitm had wounds to the back. Both Slager and Haberdasham stand over Scott's body, which remains handcuffed and face down. The same officer's account of events as reported in the NCPD incident report obtained by BuzzFeed is two sentences.

After questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview. Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life . In the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room. The American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal. Seemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone. At that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' The horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat . But Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning.

NAOMI CAMPBELL . In April 2010 Naomi Campbell, who is known for her fiery temper, stormed out of an interview with ABC news kicking their camera over on the way. The reporter had asked the supermodel about whether she had received a blood diamond from the deposed Liberian despot Charles Taylor. Naomi said: 'I didn't receive a blood diamond and I'm not going to speak about that.' The interviewer continued to push the 44-year-old until she ended the chat curtly saying: 'Thank you very much,' and walking off.

But Brazil international Marcelo says he and his team-mates are not thinking about their recent form against Tuesday's opponents. 'We have played against Atletico a lot and something always changes,' Marcelo told reporters at a press conference on Monday. There are no favourites in a match like this. We will give everything on the pitch without thinking about previous games.' 'They are a great team. They never stop fighting and they are very intense. But we are not thinking about the last games against them. Now is completely different. We have two games to show that we can beat them.'

These derbies are very difficult.' The last time Real beat Atletico was in last season's Champions League final when Sergio Ramos scored in the 93rd minute to take the game to extra-time, before Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo made it 4-1. 'I don't know how many times we have spoken about Ramos' Decima goal this week,' Marcelo added. 'I was available for the final and I never lost faith in helping the team. That's what happened and I was able to help the team win the Champions League. I consider myself very important in this team.' Summarize the article in three sentences. Summary:"}

Luke Munro, 19, and Dylon Thompson, 21, burst into the Londis shop in Cleveleys near Blackpool in October last year while the owner, his wife, and their toddler were behind the counter. The pair then pulled out a 'realistic looking' handgun and began waving it in the family's faces, demanding cash from the till, but the brave parents refused to hand it over. Luke Munro, 19, and Dylon Thompson, 21, raided a corner shop in Cleveleys near Blackpool using a 'realistic looking' handgun,pointing it at the owner, his wife, and their toddler as they hid behind the counter . When the mother and father refused to hand over cash, Munro and Thompson threw sweets at them before storming out empty handed . At that point, CCTV footage shows Munro and Thompson began throwing handfuls of sweets at the couple behind the counter, before fleeing empty handed. The duo were tracked down, and at Preston Crown Court on Wednesday Munro was jailed for five years and four months, while Thompson was sentenced to three years and four months. After the sentencing police said the attack was 'extremely distressing' for the family, who had been 'left in fear of their lives' during the raid. Detective Inspector Gareth Willis, from Lancashire Police, said: 'It's just incredibly brave of them not to give them what they wanted. 'The victims have been extremely brave in what must have been a terrifying incident for them both. Munro (left) was jailed for five years at Preston Crown Court for robbery, possessing a firearm and burglary, while Thompson was jailed for three years and four months for robbery and firearms offences . Police said the victims had been left 'extremely distressed' during the raid, and had been 'left in fear of their lives' as the gun was waved in their face . 'The female actually had her baby with her in the store when she was threatened with the weapon, which makes the offenders' actions even more reprehensible.' Detective Constable Paul Morris, from the same force, added: 'This was a terrifying ordeal for the two shop owners and their young child who were left in fear of their lives after being threatened with what they believed to be a real firearm. 'Munro and Thompson caused extreme distress for the victims involved and I hope that the sentences send a warning to criminals that crimes of this nature are treated seriously by both the police and the courts as well as bringing some closure for the victims.'

Martyn Waghorn took that a little too literally against Millwall, his red card for a senseless kick at Dan Harding punished by a Lions side determined to avoid a similar fate. When Waghorn, who played for Millwall on loan from Leicester in 2013, lashed out after failing to win a corner on the hour, it was set up for the hosts to claim three precious points. And they were duly delivered when Jimmy Abdou headed home Harding\u2019s cross with 15 minutes remaining, sending a febrile Den into raptures.

Booked: Bong, Bo-Kyung . Sent off: Waghorn, Pearson . Referee: Stephen Martin (Staffordshire) In his six seasons at the club, that was only Abdou\u2019s seventh goal. What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn\u2019t a misprint. There was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O\u2019Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall\u2019s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction. The game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm. And a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson. Millwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night. The plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points. Harris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.

But behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Eastleigh in Hampshire . Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet Summarize the article in three sentences.

The popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell. But for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters. The child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground . At least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. It is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time. A large amount of research, according to Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors. This graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter . The latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green. Researchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters. They then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990. The results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set. Among those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent. The colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row) Red bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent . Synaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.

In May 2013 she came to prominence when she defected from the Tories to Ukip with a group of councillors in Merton, south London, but she lost her seat in local election last year. She is regularly used by the party for appearances on programmes such as Question Time and Newsnight, and has been fronting the party\u2019s election campaign morning press conferences. But despite increasing talk about her leadership potential, senior Ukip figures privately admit she is unlikely to be elected in Shrewsbury & Atcham, the Shropshire seat where she is standing to become MP.

The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.

A 'freakish set of events' was how beleaguered boss Neil Redfearn described the sextet's absence after the game but Morison, who scored Leeds' goal in the 2-1 defeat at The Valley, told BBC West Yorkshire Sport: 'We're around it every day.

When asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened. 'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit. 'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.' Former Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club. Italian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. According to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday. But Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road. 'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek. 'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.' Striker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night. However, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw. 'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.

According to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday. But Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road. 'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek. 'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.' Striker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night. However, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw. 'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.

A 'freakish set of events' was how beleaguered boss Neil Redfearn described the sextet's absence after the game but Morison, who scored Leeds' goal in the 2-1 defeat at The Valley, told BBC West Yorkshire Sport: 'We're around it every day. Leeds United striker Steve Morison (centre) admits he is surprised by the chaos at Elland Road at the moment . Giuseppe Bellusci and three other Italians were among those who withdrew form the Leeds squad . Souleymane Doukara was another player that withdrew as part of the latest drama at Elland Road . 'People draw their own conclusions over what happened (with the withdrawals). It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.' When asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened. 'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit. 'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.'

Figures released by the Electoral Commission revealed that Labour received \u00a31.9million in the week to April 5, with 84 per cent coming from just three trade unions. It included a \u00a31million cheque from Unite, entrenching Labour\u2019s reliance on the union\u2019s militant boss Len McCluskey. Ed Miliband received \u00a31.6m from union barons in the first week of the election campaign, figures have revealed . Conservative donations totalled just over \u00a3500,000 in the first week of the campaign, with about a quarter coming from donors with links to hedge funds. Critics have accused Labour of being bound by its union paymasters after the party unveiled policies including raising corporation tax, introducing a mansion tax, repealing the benefits cap, nationalising the railways and scrapping employment tribunal fees. Since Mr Miliband became party leader, thanks largely to union backing, nearly \u00a37 in every \u00a310 donated to Labour has come from the unions \u2013 amounting to more than \u00a340million. In the first round of election donations registered, \u00a3506,240 was given by Unison, while the CWU gave \u00a351,072. Labour received a \u00a31million cheque from Unite, entrenching Labour\u2019s reliance on the union\u2019s militant boss Len McCluskey (pictured) The party did attract one large business donation, from property tycoon Sir David Garrard. The former tax exile, who was involved in the cash-for-honours controversy, gave \u00a3250,000. Ukip received only \u00a335,416 in the period but last night its coffers were boosted by a \u00a31million donation from Daily Express owner Richard Desmond, who gave \u00a3300,000 last year. In the week to April 5, the Conservatives received \u00a3501,850 and the Lib Dems \u00a320,000. One of the most generous gifts to the Tories \u2013 \u00a375,000 \u2013 came from Michael Tory, who was in charge of Lehman Brothers\u2019 UK investment banking division when the bank nearly crashed the West\u2019s economy. Sawsan Asfari, wife of long-time Tory donor and oil executive Ayman Asfari, gave \u00a320,000. Syrian-born Mr Asfari, who has given the Tories about \u00a3400,000, was made a \u2018business ambassador\u2019 by David Cameron last year. Home insurance boss Richard Harpin of Homeserve gave \u00a350,000. His company was fined \u00a330million last year for a mis-selling scandal. Hedge fund manager, James Diner, who once dated model Caprice, gave \u00a325,000 while socialite Fitriani Hay, who co-owns property development firm JMP Group with her racehorse-owning husband James, donated \u00a366,850. Ukip received \u00a325,000 from Robin Birley, who is also bankrolling Tory chief whip Michael Gove\u2019s re-election campaign. Nick Clegg\u2019s friend Anthony Ullmann, boss of polyester yarn company Autofil, and Joseph Zammit-Lucia, who describes himself as a \u2018compulsive contrarian\u2019 on his website, each gave \u00a310,000 to the Lib Dems.

Tragedy: Pensioner Molly Wood died after being run over by her sister's car in a Tesco car park . Investigation: The 74-year-old died after the burgundy Kia Venga, pictured, had its engine running and 'lurched forward', trapping her under the wheels . Emergency services, including an air ambulance, were called but she died at the scene outside the Tesco store in Pontefract, West Yorkshire on March 25. Her sister was also hurt in the accident but escaped with minor injuries. West Yorkshire Coroner David Hinchliff said today: 'Both ladies got out and Mrs Wood was standing in front of the vehicle while her sister went for a ticket. 'Mrs Wood was talking to some friends who were also there and it appears the engine was still running. 'It's not clear whether Mrs Wood's sister sat in the vehicle or leaned in but it was at that point that the vehicle rolled forward hitting Mrs Wood causing her to be trapped under the vehicle.' He said a provisional post-mortem examination showed Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, died of multiple injuries. Scene: Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, was on a shopping trip with her younger sister, who was also injured . Detective Sergeant Ann Drury said: 'The incident took place around midday on Wednesday, March 25 when the car, a burgundy coloured Kia Venga, was unoccupied and lurched forward colliding with two women who were standing towards the front of the vehicle. 'As a result of injuries sustained in the collision, a 74-year-old woman from Knottingley died at the scene. 'The other woman, 70, was not seriously injured in the incident but has been left badly shaken by what took place. 'This was a very tragic incident and I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision and is yet to speak to police.' The inquest was adjourned for further inquiries.

It has been 88 years since the Royals last reached the last-four juncture and the SkyBet Championship side travel to Wembley facing the unenviable task of overcoming in-form Arsenal. Reading are striving to make the FA Cup final for the first time in their history, leading to excitement understandably building in Berkshire - if not the club's Hogwood Park training ground. Reading overcame League One side Bradford with a 3-0 replay win to progress to FA Cup semi-final . Clarke, a winner as player and coach at Chelsea, has told his players not to get caught up in the occasion, with progression the only objective. 'I think when you go through to semi-finals, the only way to enjoy it is to win the game,' the Reading manager said. 'You can't go to Wembley and play the occasion. It is not about playing the occasion, we're playing Arsenal. 'For us, it has to be a day of work. We have to go there focused only on what happens on the pitch. The Royals face Premier League giants Arsenal in crunch clash on Saturday at Wembley . 'The supporters can go and enjoy the day, that's their little reward for a cup run. 'For us, it is to go there with a mentality that we are there to do a job and if we do that right we can go through.' Clarke is confident his players can make history on Saturday, even though few outsiders share his faith. One bookmaker has them at 14/1 to win and Reading's manager accepts they will have to play the 'perfect game' to overcome an Arsenal side on the back of eight straight league wins. It has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup . 'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said. 'They're winning games. 'They have terrific players. Great problems for us to solve. 'Maybe they have left their run too late to catch Chelsea at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly.' Reading have no fresh injury concerns ahead of the semi-final, with Pavel Pogrebnyak fit after a slight calf complaint ruled him out of Tuesday's 1-0 loss to table-topping Bournemouth. Steve Clarke was appointed Reading manager in December 2014 to replace Nigel Adkins . Clarke felt defeat was harsh on his side, stretching a run of winless matches to five since winning the quarter-final replay against Bradford. 'Cup competitions, one-off games, we seem to have approached it with a little bit more freedom, a little less nervousness, if you like,' the Royals boss said.

Barkley has had an indifferent campaign for the Toffees on the back of his inclusion in last summer\u2019s England World Cup party and a knee operation which disrupted his return to domestic duty. But England coach Roy Hodgson has kept faith with the 21-year-old and Martinez believes his two substitute appearances for England against Lithuania and Italy over the past week have shown that the midfielder is ready to kick on again. Roberto Martinez is backing Ross Barkley to become an even more influential player for Everton and England . Barkley impressed after coming off the substitutes bench during England's 1-1 draw in Turin . Martinez said: 'Ross is a young man but he is used to having to deal with extremes. When he plays well he is probably the best footballer England has. When he has a bad game it\u2019s the end of the world. 'He has achieved an incredible level of maturity this season. 'He had to go through a period of difficulty the same way we have as a team and I think he has learned a lot. 'It doesn\u2019t surprise me, he has had a big impact when he came on in both games with England. He was ready to do that. Barkley replaced Theo Walcott in the second half and looked bright as the Three Lions earned a draw . The 21-year-old celebrates after scoring for Everton during their 3-0 victory against Newcastle . 'He will benefit from the experiences of this difficult season. This is his second full season in an important role in the squad. He enjoys that responsibility and taking responsibility in big games. 'He has an incredible technical ability and, with the physicality he has, you don\u2019t see many players in world football with those capabilities. 'We know who Ross is and how important he is for the future of Everton.\u201d Everton\u2019s struggles this season have seen them flirt with relegation and although wins over Newcastle and QPR have eased their plight, Martinez insists guaranteeing safety is still their only immediate target going into Saturday\u2019s visit of sixth-placed Southampton. Martinez insists guaranteeing safety is still Everton's only immediate target ahead of Saturday's match . The Everton boss added: 'There\u2019s no distraction from our league position. That\u2019s everything that matters. 'Those two wins have given us a real sense of confidence and belief for what\u2019s in front of us. 'Forty points is still the target. Nothing has changed until we achieve that and then we will try and get as high up the table as we can.' Top scorer Romelu Lukaku will face a fitness test on the hamstring injury that kept him out of Belgium\u2019s internationals but midfielder Darron Gibson is expected to be fit to face the Saints. Wingers Kevin Mirallas and Steven Pienaar have also recovered from injury and could be included. Top scorer Romelu Lukaku (centre) will face a fitness test on his hamstring injury .

At the moment, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Hydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily . Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention. It uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. Lead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces. Water splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively. The energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two. The new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process. It can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner. The process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost. With this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency. \u2018Oxygen is the most difficult bit,\u2019 Dr Hintermair explained. Their catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn\u2019t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is \u2018almost non-existent\u2019. The major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar. \u2018We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can\u2019t store it very well,\u2019 Dr Hintermair continued. \u2018We can put it in a battery but you can\u2019t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet. \u2018So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.\u2019 This, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical. On this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process. The large bubbles are oxygen, while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen .

But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Hydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily . Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention. It uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. Lead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces. Water splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively. The energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two. The new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process. It can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner. The process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost. With this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency. \u2018Oxygen is the most difficult bit,\u2019 Dr Hintermair explained. Their catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn\u2019t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is \u2018almost non-existent\u2019. The major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar. \u2018We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can\u2019t store it very well,\u2019 Dr Hintermair continued. \u2018We can put it in a battery but you can\u2019t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet. \u2018So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.\u2019 This, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical.

'We have not objected to the 4pm kick-off time at all,' he told Sportsmail. 'That 4pm has been agreed is testament to the excellent behaviour of the overwhelming majority of fans who have attended previous derby fixtures. 'It is the positive behaviour of both sets of fans at previous derby fixtures that means we feel confident this Sunday\u2019s fixture will continue that tradition of the fixture being a safe and enjoyable one.'

The 'meal deal' (which is not always a meal, or a deal) has seen us stave off the hunger pangs with soggy sandwiches, slimy salads and salty soups, spending an average of \u00a31,840 a year. But we could save up to \u00a31,300 a year if we just prepared our lunch at home. Cheese, crackers and charcuterie is a simple and delicious lunch which can be easily assembled in the office . Food website Food52's 'Not Sad Desk Lunch' series demonstrates just how simple it can be to bring healthy, cost-effective, and delicious lunches to work. These incredibly detailed ideas and recipes show how to make everything from easy-to-assemble options such cheese and crackers, to more complicated steamed Chinese buns, and Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches . Each recipe on Food52 is contributed by a member of the team who promises to keep your midday meals 'both interesting and pretty.' If you're after something simple, cheese, crackers and charcuterie will do the job. Simply choose your favourites, assemble and eat; and If you're vegetarian, swap meat for pickled vegetables and you're good to go. Make something complicated like stuffed dumplings (left) or keep it simple with a toast tartine (right) Hannah Petertil has some inspired combinations which include Cheddar, apple, and bacon jam; mozzarella and prosciuotto or manchego and dried apricots. Keeping with the theme, you could also use the handy cracker to spread a variety of toppings. Make a Greek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta; a hummus cracker with roasted red pepper on top; pesto crackers with thinly sliced prosciutto; or smashed avocado crackers. Don't feel like spreading? Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go. Workers could save up to \u00a31,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed. More than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of \u00a31,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals. In comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just \u00a3552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping \u00a31,288. The startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home. Pita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables. Experiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes. Remember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita. Still sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine.

The Belgian striker, back to form under manager Tim Sherwood with eight goals in six games, said his side must continue to stretch their lead over the drop zone. Villa are six points clear of Queens Park Rangers in 18th but the gap could close this weekend with Burnley and Leicester in Premier League action and Sherwood\u2019s team in the FA Cup semi-final. Christian Benteke rises above Fererico Fazio to head the winning goal for Aston Villa against Tottenham . Benteke points to the skies in celebration after scoring his eighth goal in six matches . Benteke said: \u2018The more the better, I think it's risky to say we can take three points and we're finished. We have to try to win every game. \u2018Saturday was a massive three points because now we're six points clear of QPR so it's very important for us to be far off them.\u2019 Benteke, 24, said the match against Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team at Wembley was the biggest of his career. \u2018For the moment, yes,\u2019 he said. \u2018It (missing the World Cup) was hard but now it's in the past, I'm looking forward to playing the semi final. Benteke thinks it would be risky to think that one more win will be enough to ensure survival . \u2018Liverpool are a good team but the thing with the FA Cup is it's still something special. It's 50-50 for me but some will say they are favourites. \u2018Wembley is something good and special because it's a semi final, it's close to the final and we have to do everything to be there again.\u2019 Benteke believes his partnership with Gabby Agbonalhor can destroy defences. He added: \u2018He (Sherwood) said to the team we have to play to our strengths, to play with me and Gabby. \u2018He helped me to destroy the defenders, with two we're always better than one.
