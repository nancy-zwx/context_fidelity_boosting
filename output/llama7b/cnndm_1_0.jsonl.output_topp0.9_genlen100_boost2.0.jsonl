Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. \"My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),\" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. \"It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner.\" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical.

Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the attack on a Top Gear producer which led to him being sacked from the hit BBC show. Police had opened an investigation into the incident, which took place at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire last month after Clarkson had been filming Top Gear in the area. However, after the victim Oisin Tymon said that he did not want to press charges, officers have now decided to drop the probe without taking action against Clarkson. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: \u2018North Yorkshire Police has now completed its routine enquiries following the incident at Hawes involving Mr Jeremy Clarkson, and we will not be pursuing this matter any further. \u2018North Yorkshire Police takes a thorough and victim-led approach to all investigations. \u2018Last week, the person at the centre of the incident, Mr Tymon, said that he did not wish the police to take action on his behalf. \u2018However, at that point we still needed to speak to some members of the public who were present at the time of the incident, who had been affected by the event, and whose views also needed to be considered. \u2018Now that all the interviews are complete, we have properly established that there is no need for further police action.\u2019 The incident, described as a 'fracas' by BBC officials, occurred when Clarkson discovered that the hotel where he was staying could not serve him a hot meal following a day's filming. An official report found that the 54-year-old presenter punched Mr Tymon in the mouth before being dragged away by a witness, causing the producer to go to A&E for emergency treatment. He also verbally abused him for 20 minutes, blaming Mr Tymon for failing to ensure that he could get a steak at the hotel. Victim: Oisin Tymon told police he did not wish to press charges against Mr Clarkson . Mr Clarkson was suspended as Top Gear presenter as soon as news of the fight came to light, and after the report was released the BBC announced that it would not renew his contract. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately, and the producer told North Yorkshire Police he did not want to see Mr Clarkson prosecuted. Despite his sacking, Mr Clarkson is set to take part in a series of Top Gear Live shows alongside co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May, although the performances will be rebranded. The BBC has said that Top Gear is likely to continue in some form, but Mr Hammond and Mr May are not expected to return. The star initially received widespread public support - including from his friend, Prime Minister David Cameron - in the aftermath of the incident, while one million people signed a petition calling for the BBC to reinstate him.

On Monday, the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy, stating that \"such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers.\" This bolsters the association's previous positions to oppose the use of the term \"drug\" for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases. The group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection, said Michelle Spinnler, spokeswoman for the American Pharmacists Association. That spotlight includes a January Supreme Court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in Oklahoma. This was prompted by Clayton Lockett's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack. In Georgia last month, the execution of female death row inmate Kelly Renee Gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy. Thirty-two sates allow capital punishment, and lethal injection is still the most common method. Last month, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available. Of the eight inmates currently on death row in Utah, three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad. Pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection. In Texas, the department of criminal justice told CNN in March they are running out of their supply. In July 2011, Lundbeck Inc., the manufacturer of pentobarbital, decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment. The companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose, so states then turned to compounded preparations, Spinnler said. \"Pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way.\" she says.

Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. \"My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,\" Klitschko told CNN. \"I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. \"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. \"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said. \"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy.

Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. \"My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,\" Klitschko told CNN. \"I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. \"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. \"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said. \"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want. \"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and Summarize the article in three sentences. Summary:"}

Victim: DNA tests reportedly link the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain (pictured) on Sunday . Mr Cazeneuve said the suspect was found on a street in the 13th arrondissement of Paris with a bullet in his leg, and bleeding heavily. He originally claimed to be the victim of an attack by criminals, but officers followed the trail of blood to his car, where they found a Kalashnikov assaultrifle, and a Sig-Sauer automatic pistol. There were also stolen police armbands which would enable him to pose as a plain clothes officer. In Ghlam's student accommodation, detectives later found three automatic rifles, handguns, and bulletproof vests. There were also Jihadi flags and literature, false passports, and plans for attacks on 'one or two' churches in the Paris area. DNA analysis reportedly linked the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain, who was originally from Caudry, in northern France. The arrested man was an Algerian national studying computer science in Paris, and was known to the intelligence services. The man had been considered a likely candidate to travel to Syria to fight with the Islamic State terrorist organisation, said Mr Cazeneuve, and was officially under surveillance. Tragic: Ghalm's arrest came just hours after the murder of Aurelie Chatelain (pictured), a 33-year-old mother and fitness instructor, who was riddled with bullets as she sat in her car in the Paris suburb of Villejuif .

Hundreds of British teenagers see ISIS as 'pop idols' like One Direction and Justin Bieber, putting children in danger of being radicalised, the country's most senior Muslim prosecutor has said. Nafir Afzal said teenagers are at risk of 'jihadimania' and warned that 'another 7/7' could happen unless Britain makes sweeping changes to the way it tackles terrorism. Mr Afzal, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the north-west, said children are 'manipulated' by Islamists and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation. He told the Guardian's Nigel Bunyan: 'The boys want to be like them and the girls want to be with them. That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image. 'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers \u2013 they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.' Mr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services. The prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack. He believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures. 'At the moment, even the language is wrong. People talk about Isis as if they have some kind of religious basis or political dimension \u2013 a kind of glossy, glorious campaign,' he said. Mr Afzal said teenagers are 'manipulated' by ISIS (file picture) and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation . The prosecutor said some Muslim teenagers see Islamists as 'pop idols' like Justin Bieber (left) and One Direction (Harry Styles, right) 'The reality is that they're no more than narcissistic, murderous cowboys. We need to stand up and say that very, very clearly, rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols.' Hundreds of young Muslims are thought to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, but Mr Afzal believes there are far more 'ticking time bombs' still in Britain. His comments came as it emerged that the Labour councillor's son caught trying to cross from Turkey to Syria with his family may be part of an extremist group. Waheed Ahmed, 21 \u2013 the son of councillor Shakil Ahmed \u2013 is said to be a member of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which advocates a global Muslim caliphate, similar to the one established by ISIS.

From a psychedelic image of a surfer in Hawaii to British Airways' introduction of the Concorde, the posters reflect the eras in which they were created by some of the best creative minds of the time, including Ivan Chermayeff, Otl Aicher, Massimo Vignelli and Saul Bass, Academy Award-winning filmmaker. The posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience and passengers dressed smart . The book hails the designers' creative genius and uses special techniques to replicate their work as accurately as possible . In addition to drawings the adverts include photos of natural beauty spots, including Sydney Harbour (left) and Bermuda's beaches (right) Mr Huhne\u2019s book hails their creative genius and uses 17 colours, five types of varnishes and two methods of foil printing and embossing to replicate their work as accurately as possible.

Vanessa Favia, attorney for 19-year-old Heather Mack, has filed court documents for her client agreeing to turn over funds for the care of four-month-old Stella. CBS reports the petition asks for around a half a million dollars to be transferred to Stella, who was born in Kerobakan Prison and who has urgent needs, including clothing and baby wipes. Scroll down for video . Child care: A US-based attorney for Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murdering her socialite mother in Bali, has filed for about half a million dollars to be transferred to Mack's daughter Stella from Mack's trust fund . Heather Mack smiles at her baby daughter Stella before her sentencing hearing in Denpasar, Bali, in March . Mack wept as prosecutors said she should be sentenced to 15 years - but spared her the death penalty . 'What ever your opinion of the adults in this case, I believe everyone would agree that the baby bears no culpability in this truly sad affair,' Favia said in a press release. Mack filed a claim in court back in February that her uncle, Wiese-Mack's brother and trustee of her estate, had blocked her access to the funds, according to NBC. A judge ordered $150,000 be released to pay for Mack's defense, along with another $2,240 for living expenses, but required that Mack not share the money with anyone. Indonesian officials accused Mack of helping her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, murder her mother at a luxury Bali hotel before stuffing her body in a suitcase last August. The pair are awaiting sentencing, with prosecutors having asked for a sentence of 15 years for Mack and 18 for Schaefer. Chief Prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya said Mack 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother,' but wanted her to be spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby.' The 21-year-old gazes at his baby daughter, held by a relative, before his sentence demand hearing . Mack claimed her daughter - who had to return to hospital shortly after her birth with jaundice - has six fingers on her left hand . Since being held in jail, the 19-year-old from Chicago has been keeping her newborn Stella with her in the crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison. In a bizarre comment from her holding cell last week, Mack said with a grin that Stella has six fingers on her left hand, saying, 'But don't worry, she's OK, thank you.'

Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant . Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: \"Has she got a baby in her belly?\"' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible.

'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness . 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week.

As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said.

Unlike Bates, they are not charged with a crime, but have come under criticism for pinning Harris' head to the ground as he said, \"I'm losing my breath.\" Police appear on video saying, \"F*ck your breath,\" apparently in response. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify the nature of the threats, but said he was \"very concerned\" for their safety and that of their families. He did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do. Another sheriff's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency's drug unit pending the review of the April 2 shooting of Harris following a weapons sting. Glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions, saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving Bates has been settled. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris' death. Bates, who is free on $25,000 bond pending trial, shot Harris with his handgun after calling out, \"Taser, Taser,\" -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue Harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies. Amid questions about his age -- 73 -- training and friendship with Glanz, Bates has said the shooting was accidental, and has apologized to the family. Lawyer releases training records for Tulsa deputy charged in killing . On Monday, Glanz also apologized to Harris' family. \"We are sorry Eric was taken from you,\" he said. But he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing, and said Monday that the FBI had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. Bates is white. Harris was black. There have been allegations, first reported by the Tulsa World newspaper, that some of Bates' training records had been forged, or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force. The sheriff denied those allegations, saying he was certain Bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training. He said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records, and said he had not issued any training waivers for Bates, with whom he has been friends for more than two decades. But he said he supported prosecutor's decision to proceed with the case.

The news comes as the club wait to assess the full extent of Gareth Bale's calf injury, picked up in the same game. The connection between the former Tottenham pair is an essential part of Carlo Ancelotti's side's chances of picking up silverware this season.

Cristiano Ronaldo was the first Madrid player to go over to Gareth Bale, who picked up an injury on Saturday . Luka Modric hobbles off the Bernabeu pitch have sprained a ligament in his right knee on Saturday . Modric could still be back for the Champions League final but Real Madrid will have to get there without him. On Wednesday when they play the second leg of their quarter-final against Atletico Madrid, poised at 0-0 after the first 90 minutes, they will almost certainly also be without Bale. It\u2019s one year on from his dramatic winner in the Copa del Rey final but Bale, who also scored in the Champions League final and the World Club Cup last year, is likely to be in a race to get back before the Champions League semi-finals on 5-6 May should Real reach them. Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu on Saturday evening . Real Madrid will have Karim Benzema back against Atletico so he will partner Crisitano Ronaldo up front with James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Isco plus whoever Ancelotti calls upon to replace Modric in a midfield four. German international Sami Khedira and former Real Sociedad player Asier Illaramendi are the options. Bale\u2019s absence will be a massive blow for Ancelotti. He said in midweek: \u2018Bale was fantastic last season and has been very good this year. He scored goals in the finals last season and he will be important for us as this season reaches its climax.\u2019 And most Real Madrid supporters see Modric as even more important to the team. The Croatian injured himself towards the end of last year and when he missed three months of football it coincided with the team\u2019s worst run of form. The Welsh forward was forced off and faces a race to be fit for Real's Champions League quarter-final .

'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added. 'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens.

They say the results show just how modern lifestyles and diets have changed us - and that the bacteria they found could be potentially beneficial to modern society. Researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are an indigenous ethnic group in the Amazonian region of South America. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are hunter-gatherers. They gather wild bananas, seasonal fruits, palm hearts and cassava. They hunt birds, small mammals, crabs, frogs, small fish and the occasional peccary, monkey or tapir. The group doesn't grow food or domesticate livestock. The researchers found that Yanomami people harbor microbiomes with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. 'That tells us that Western diets and lifestyles have a great impact on our microbiomes', experts at University of San Diego said. 'Studying the microbiomes of people in remote areas may hold the key to understanding microbes we have lost through antibiotics, sealed buildings and lack of exposure to the outdoors,' said study co-author Rob Knight. In the new study published April 17 by Science Advances, researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. This information revealed, for the first time, the species of bacteria that co-exist with people who have never been exposed to industrialized society, including Western food and antibiotics. 'Our findings emphasize the need for extensive characterization of the function of the microbiome and resistome in remote nonwesternized populations before globalization of modern practices affects potentially beneficial bacteria harbored in the human body,' the researchers wrote. Many Yanomami now regularly interact with Western civilization through trade, but some villages have never had contact with non-Yanomami people. One such unmapped village was first spotted by an army helicopter passing overhead in 2008. In 2009, a medical mission landed there. As part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered. The samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study. Yanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests . Thousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international. The Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade. The Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a Summarize the article in three sentences. Summary:"}

Shinjiro Kumagai is a 'mild mannered' clergyman at a local Buddhist temple called Gokurakuji in Kitakyushu, southwest Japan. But after the days work is done, he dresses up as iconic Japanese sci-fi TV hero Kamen Rider 1 and takes to the streets to lay down the law, according to Japan Today. Bizarre images depict Kumagai riding around Kitakyushu in full Kamen Rider gear - which makes him appear like a giant grasshopper- and the trademark Cyclone motorcycle, fitted with fake jets. Scroll down for video . Japanese priest Shinjiro Kumagai (pictured) has vowed to crack down on drink driving by dressing as a superhero in his spare time and laying down the law . Unlike some superheros, Kumagai has the full support of police and even dons an armband certifying him as an official drink-drive patrolman. He's also funded by his church, where the head Buddhist Priest Fukumitsu - also a devout Kamen Rider fan - funds his costume and bike. Kumagai said his sponsor was more than happy to help the cause . 'He is a real fan of Kamen Rider 1 and has been collecting memorabilia for 20 years, so when he heard about what I was doing he jumped at the chance to help.' Images also depict Kumagai undertaking some more mundane acts like eating street food and feeding cows. While the he takes the patrol work very seriously, pictures depict Kumagai undertaking some more mundane acts in his superhero attire like feeding cows . Unlike some superheros, Kumagai has the full support of police and even dons an armband certifying him as an official drink-drive patrolman . Kamen Rider was a popular superhero series running in Japan from 1971 to 1973 and later adapted into a comic book. The show depicts a man who was mutated into a grasshopper-esqe cyborg by a terrorist organization and his battle to defeat them. Dressing up as cartoons or superheroes - known as Cosplay - is a huge industry in Japan with fans spending thousands to look like their fictitious idols. An image snapped by someone who spotted Kumagai on patrol: the popularity of Kamen Rider means locals have welcomed the helmeted protector with open arms . The popularity of the show means locals have welcomed the helmeted protector with open arms. Shopkeeper Kageki Umeta, 43, said: 'he is doing a very good job. On one hand it is quite geeky and comical although the kids love to see him riding around.' 'But on the other he is actually raising awareness of the dangers of drink driving and is catching people at it who he then reports to the police. 'Every city should have a Kamen Rider.'

Downton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body\u2019s management board ahead of their spring meeting today. The decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England\u2019s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just \u2018too accident prone\u2019. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . It was Downton who took the huge call to sack Kevin Pietersen and then re-appointed Peter Moores, calling him \u2018the outstanding coach of his generation\u2019. He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain. Former England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate. Ultimately it was England\u2019s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton. \u2018The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,\u2019 said Harrison in an ECB statement. \u2018The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.\u2019 Michael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton . Vaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender . That new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector. That makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today\u2019s board meeting at Lord\u2019s.

In other tweets, the reporter mocked the 'these brave Anzacs' and accused Diggers of committing war crimes. 'Remembering the summary execution, widespread rape and theft committed by these 'brave' Anzacs in Egypt, Palestine and Japan,' he tweeted.

An androgynous, meek-and-mild messiah during the anything-goes 1970s. A studly action-figure hero after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Flip through the gallery above, and you'll see what I mean. If you turned on the television this past Sunday, though, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal. If not following all of history's clues -- Hollywood has yet to cast an actual Jew as Jesus -- then at least inching closer. Flipping through the channels on a day millions of Western Christians celebrated the resurrection of their savior, viewers could choose from \"Killing Jesus,\" a NatGeo production rebroadcast Sunday on Fox. \"A.D.,\" NBC's sequel to the blockbuster miniseries \"The Bible,\" and \"Finding Jesus,\" CNN's addition to the ever-burgeoning body of Christ-centered TV fare. Does God have a prayer in Hollywood? What unites these disparate projects, besides a recognition that Jesus always draws an audience and the Good Book is good for business, is the type of men chosen to play Christ. They are brawny, with brown eyes and dark complexions. They look like men who could be carpenters, if not in Nazareth, than at least in the Mediterranean neighborhood. Haaz Sleiman, from \"Killing Jesus,\" was born and raised in Lebanon. He's also Muslim, a fact that annoyed some Christians, who took to Twitter to voice their displeasure. Adam Bond, a British actor of mixed heritage, including Native American, portrays Jesus during the historical reenactments in \"Finding Jesus.\" And Juan Pablo Di Pace -- a Argentinian named after the late St. Pope John Paul II -- takes a starring role in \"A.D.,\" replacing Diogo Morgado, dubbed \"hot Jesus,\" by some, \"smarmy Jesus\" by others. You could make the case that authenticity is the coin of our current entertainment realm, and that filmmakers are competing to make their work as historically accurate as possible. Contemporary viewers are too savvy to stomach the fake beards and odd accents that littered the camels-and-sandals epics of eras past. But there's another, deeper meaning behind our new, multicultural Jesuses, scholars say. \"Filmmakers and networks are in touch with the fact that the complexion of America has changed,\" said Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, a religion scholar and author of \"Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ.\" \"A large number of Americans are people of color: Latinos and Middle Easterners and people from India,\" Humphries-Books continued. \"That means the audience base is shifting in various and important ways.\" The audience base may be shifting, but it's also tuning in.

Seven of Slager's fellow cops responded to his call forback-up after the shooting - as handcuffed Walter Scott lay dead or dying with five bullet wounds to the back. But the fact that his wounds were to the back do not feature in subsequent accounts of the shooting given to the media, or in the force's incident report filed after the shooting. Officers also told an internal report that they gave Scott CPR, but the video only shows them checking his pulse and standing over his body. One officer is also present when Slager picks up an object - allegedly his Taser - and puts it near Scott's body. Scroll down for video . Questions: Officer Clarence Haberdashem searches Walter Scott's handcuffed body in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. He later told colleagues that he administered CPR . Scott's father said of the incident: 'It would have never come to light [had video not emerged]. They would have swept it under the rug, like they did with many others.' Slager's former attorney had initially claimed that the officer fired on Scott during a struggle for his Taser and had felt threatened. 'When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser \u2014 as trained by the department \u2014 and then a struggle ensued,' David Aylor said. 'The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. [He] felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.' On Wednesday North Charleston Mayor Keith Sumney refused to answer a question on Slager's fellow officers' culpability, saying it would be addressed in the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division [SLED] investigation. There are also questions over discrepancies between responding officers' version of events in an internal incident report and what the witness video shows. It is not known what accounts those officers gave to the subsequent SLED investigation. The video of the shooting shows Officer Clarence Haberdasham was the first to arrive on scene as Scott lay handcuffed on the ground. As Haberdasham arrives, Slager runs back to position where he fired the fatal shots and appears to retrieve a dark object - claimed to be his Taser - and places it next to Scott's body. Haberdasham dons a pair of blue gloves, checks Scott's pulse, goes through his pockets and speaks on his radio and then walks away. Radio records show that an officer reported that Scott had gunshot wounds to the chest and right side and was 'unresponsive'. He later added that the vicitm had wounds to the back. Both Slager and Haberdasham stand over Scott's body, which remains handcuffed and face down. The same officer's account of events as reported in the NCPD incident report obtained by BuzzFeed is two sentences.

An official at the International Monetary Fund reportedly admitted that he cannot envisage a successful conclusion to the country\u2019s bailout. Greece this week repeated threats to stop paying off its loan and default on its debt if Europe refuses to release more funds. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors . This would make it harder for the country to remain in the eurozone, although no state has ever left and there is no official exit process. Poul Thomsen, the IMF's Europe Director has been quoted by the Greek media as saying he could not see a successful conclusion to the country's current bail out. The fund's Europe chief reportedly told his executive board that negotiations were not going as hoped, the Daily Telegraph reported. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors. One Greek official has been quoted by the Financial Times as saying that if the European Central Bank did not play ball with the Mediterranean Eurozone member there could be no alternative to a default. Mr. Thomsen also issued a warning over Greece's recent, weak economic performance. He met with Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis earlier this month. Greece repaid a roughly \u20ac450 million loan instalment to the International Monetary last week but Athens' financial problems, as outlined by Mr. Thomsen, have renewed fears the country might miss the IMF payment of \u20ac200m payment on the 1st May and another for \u20ac745m 11 days later. This could lead to he EU member being forced, eventually, to leave the eurozone. The IMF debt stems from Greece's international bailout, under which the country was extended \u20ac240 billion in rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF to prevent bankruptcy. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (left) met with Mr. Thomsen who expressed worry over the Greek economy. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' (right) government has been talking with creditors since January . Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason. He said at a conference last week that Greece was 'not going to sign on the dotted line of anything you give us just to get the next loan tranche', 'At the very same time,' he added, 'we need to have a fiscal plan that makes sense. At the moment Greece is committed.'

Millwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night. The plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points. Harris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.

But behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Eastleigh in Hampshire . Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet Summarize the article in three sentences.

The results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set. Among those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent. The colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row) Red bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent . Synaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. Some people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell Summarize the article in three sentences. Summary:"}

That is, until nurses and Hurd's friends brought prom right to her bed at the Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha. After a sudden infection landed Madison Hurd, 16, in the hospital and forced her to miss her high school's prom, nurses and her friends brought the Great Gatsby-themed dance to her bed instead . Nurses spent their day off doing Hurd's nails, makeup and hair, getting music and a cake, and decorating her room with streamers and balloons . Nurses spent their day off doing Hurd's nails, makeup and hair, getting music and a cake, and decorating her room with streamers and balloons, according to Live Well Nebraska. They even made sure the decorations matched the Great Gatsby-themed dance Hurd had been planning and organizing for the last year with her student council at Milford High School. The stunning turquoise ball gown Hurd had started an after-school job to afford was laid over her hospital gown, and her boyfriend flew in from Alabama with a tux and a corsage. Hurd's mother Catrece said the nurse's efforts brought her to tears. 'It's their day off. When I think about it, I just don't know what else to say,' she told WOWT.

The teen was hospitalized on Monday with what was initially thought to be a stomach bug that turned into sepsis, a life-threatening complication of an infection. Catrece said the sepsis attacked Hurd's muscles and her heart, and she has not been able to leave the hospital since. 'When we found out she was having some heart problems, that's when we knew there was no way she was going to be able to go to the prom,' she told KETV. Hurd has since been diagnosed with myocarditis, an inflammation of the middle layer of the heart wall. The teen said she was 'exhausted' but thought it was awesome that the hospital put in so much work to make her dream come true. 'I'm just very happy, very happy,' she said. 'This is better than real prom.' Hurd was hospitalized on Monday with what was initially thought to be a stomach bug and turned into sepsis, a life-threatening complication of an infection .

On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.'

The Royals face Premier League giants Arsenal in crunch clash on Saturday at Wembley . 'The supporters can go and enjoy the day, that's their little reward for a cup run. 'For us, it is to go there with a mentality that we are there to do a job and if we do that right we can go through.' Clarke is confident his players can make history on Saturday, even though few outsiders share his faith. One bookmaker has them at 14/1 to win and Reading's manager accepts they will have to play the 'perfect game' to overcome an Arsenal side on the back of eight straight league wins. It has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup . 'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said. 'They're winning games. 'They have terrific players. Great problems for us to solve. 'Maybe they have left their run too late to catch Chelsea at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly.' Reading have no fresh injury concerns ahead of the semi-final, with Pavel Pogrebnyak fit after a slight calf complaint ruled him out of Tuesday's 1-0 loss to table-topping Bournemouth. Steve Clarke was appointed Reading manager in December 2014 to replace Nigel Adkins . Clarke felt defeat was harsh on his side, stretching a run of winless matches to five since winning the quarter-final replay against Bradford. 'Cup competitions, one-off games, we seem to have approached it with a little bit more freedom, a little less nervousness, if you like,' the Royals boss said. 'I think the league campaign has been disappointing. There is sort of a feeling of doom and gloom around the league campaign this year which is never nice.

A burglar who broke into a young teacher's home and sexually assaulted her as she lay in bed has been freed by a judge who handed him a community sentence. The decision's been slammed by a Victim Support charity worker, who said that 'victims deserve justice', after the 24-year-old teacher was left traumatised by the ordeal. Judge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' during the case at Birmingham Crown Court, which has left her 'petrified' and afraid to go out. But Joshua Sweet, 20, from Birmingham, was freed and given a three-year community order on account of an early plea and having spent just two months in jail awaiting his court appearance. Madhu Rai, prosecuting, said Sweet broke into the victim's home and took items including car keys and a mobile phone before making his way upstairs, where the victim was asleep. In the dead of night, she awoke to find the intruder 'standing beside her bed' and screamed, which is when the terrifying assault began. Sweet then rolled down her duvet and touched the defendant sexually, saying 'you're not going to make any noise are you?' Miss Rai said the woman was extremely frightened and tried to divert the defendant. Sweet touched the woman\u2019s bottom and upper thigh but as he took hold of the waistband of her pyjama bottoms, her house-mate, the owner of the property, came into the room and he fled. The police were called and Sweet was arrested nearby, but the victim's ordeal continued. In a statement she said she had been 'petrified' at finding a stranger in her bedroom and that the incident, which had caused her to take time off work, had left her feeling vulnerable and unsafe. She said she had put a bolt on her bedroom door and had been reluctant to come out. Sentencing guidelines for sexual assaults range up to eight years for the most serious cases. And although the nature of this case falls in the lower end of the scale, the sentence angered a victim support charity that said offenders 'must be given a punishment that fits their crime'. Joshua Sweet, 20, admitted burglary and sexual assault and was given a three-year community order, ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work and must register as a sex offender for five years . Carolyn Hodrien, victim services director for Victim Support, said: 'From supporting thousands of victims of sexual assault, we know what a devastating impact it can have on people's lives. 'Victims deserve justice and for this to happen offenders must be given a punishment that fits their crime. Community orders can be a really effective way to manage some offenders, but should never be issued for a serious offence or as a quick-fix.' Sweet, 20, of Alwold Road, Weoley Castle, Birmingham, who admitted burglary and sexual assault, was also ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work and register as Summarize the article in three sentences.

A burglar who broke into a young teacher's home and sexually assaulted her as she lay in bed has been freed by a judge who handed him a community sentence. The decision's been slammed by a Victim Support charity worker, who said that 'victims deserve justice', after the 24-year-old teacher was left traumatised by the ordeal. Judge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' during the case at Birmingham Crown Court, which has left her 'petrified' and afraid to go out. But Joshua Sweet, 20, from Birmingham, was freed and given a three-year community order on account of an early plea and having spent just two months in jail awaiting his court appearance. Madhu Rai, prosecuting, said Sweet broke into the victim's home and took items including car keys and a mobile phone before making his way upstairs, where the victim was asleep. In the dead of night, she awoke to find the intruder 'standing beside her bed' and screamed, which is when the terrifying assault began. Sweet then rolled down her duvet and touched the defendant sexually, saying 'you're not going to make any noise are you?' Miss Rai said the woman was extremely frightened and tried to divert the defendant. Sweet touched the woman\u2019s bottom and upper thigh but as he took hold of the waistband of her pyjama bottoms, her house-mate, the owner of the property, came into the room and he fled. The police were called and Sweet was arrested nearby, but the victim's ordeal continued. In a statement she said she had been 'petrified' at finding a stranger in her bedroom and that the incident, which had caused her to take time off work, had left her feeling vulnerable and unsafe. She said she had put a bolt on her bedroom door and had been reluctant to come out. Sentencing guidelines for sexual assaults range up to eight years for the most serious cases.

A penchant for beer, fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing. But you would be wrong. For de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age. It sounds bonkers but de Grey's theories have gained him some high-profile supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet. PayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth \u00a31.5 billion) donated \u00a32.4 million to de Grey's anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS). Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing. While many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who has talked of 'curing death') and Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who are all showing an interest in gerontology, or the study of ageing. Google's Bill Maris, who heads the computer giant's investment arm, said: 'We have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision. I hope to live long enough not to die.' One source at a leading software company told The Mail on Sunday: 'De Grey has tapped a rich vein in Silicon Valley. He's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now, of course, want to live for ever.' De Grey was raised in Chelsea by his artist mother Cordelia, who left him \u00a311 million when she died in 2011 \u2013 \u00a39 million of which he has invested in his company. He spent the remainder on a 'very nice house'. He never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at Harrow. Scroll down for video . 'Ageing is a disease that can and should be cured,' he says. 'I've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking. Anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked. Gandhi said first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you and then they say, \"We were with you all along\".' De Grey's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car \u2013 'replace the parts, clean it up, keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date'. His argument is that cellular decay causes ageing, illness and, ultimately, death, and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body Summarize the article in three sentences.

It uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. Lead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces. Water splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively. The energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two.

It can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner.

A student who tried to cheat his way to a better degree by hacking into the university computers and changing his marks has been jailed. Imran Uddin, 25, who was studying science, bought keyboard spying equipment on the internet which he then connected to a number of university computers. Through the software, which recorded key strokes, he was able to find out the passwords that staff were typing in to log in to the computers. He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself. After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments. On one paper, he upped his mark from 57 per cent, a lower second grade, to 73 per cent, a first. He carried out his plot using keyboard \u2018shadowing\u2019 devices which look like a USB stick and can be bought for as little as \u00a349 on the internet. He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying. The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course. At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree. He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act. Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018For reasons not entirely clear to me, whether it was monetary, or pride, or a desire to outperform others, you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that. I consider your actions were planned and persistent.\u2019 He warned that Uddin\u2019s behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system. The judge added that he felt compelled to put Uddin behind bars as a \u2018deterrence\u2019 to others. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018This kind of conduct undermines, or has the potential to undermine, public confidence in the degree system, set up by this university. I have decided I cannot pass a suspended sentence because there needs to be an element of deterrence.\u2019 Uddin was found out after staff discovered the devices when several computers were upgraded on October 7 last year. When they removed the protective casing from the computers in the bio-science building, the spying devices were discovered. Staff then began checking other university computer equipment and a further three spying devices were found. Madhu Rai, prosecuting, said: \u2018It is effectively a case where the defendant has hacked into a number of computers at the university where he was studying for a degree in bio-science.\u2019 Miss Rai said one tracker had been attached to a computer in a \u2018staff only\u2019 area to obtain the password of employee Christine Chapman, who had access to exam grade software.

A student who tried to cheat his way to a better degree by hacking into the university computers and changing his marks has been jailed. Imran Uddin, 25, who was studying science, bought keyboard spying equipment on the internet which he then connected to a number of university computers. Through the software, which recorded key strokes, he was able to find out the passwords that staff were typing in to log in to the computers. He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself. After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments. On one paper, he upped his mark from 57 per cent, a lower second grade, to 73 per cent, a first. He carried out his plot using keyboard \u2018shadowing\u2019 devices which look like a USB stick and can be bought for as little as \u00a349 on the internet. He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying. The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course. At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree. He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act. Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018For reasons not entirely clear to me, whether it was monetary, or pride, or a desire to outperform others, you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that. I consider your actions were planned and persistent.\u2019 He warned that Uddin\u2019s behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system. The judge added that he felt compelled to put Uddin behind bars as a \u2018deterrence\u2019 to others. Judge Burbridge said: \u2018This kind of conduct undermines, or has the potential to undermine, public confidence in the degree system, set up by this university.
